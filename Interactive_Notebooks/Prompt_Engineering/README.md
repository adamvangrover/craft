# Interactive Notebooks for Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the Prompt Engineering module! This set of notebooks is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to prompt engineering for credit analysts.

## Notebooks in this Module

1.  **[01_Foundations_of_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb](./01_Foundations_of_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb)**
    *   This notebook covers the fundamental principles of prompt engineering, including clarity, context, and role-playing. It features interactive widgets to help you practice and understand these concepts.

2.  **[02_Advanced_Prompting_Techniques.ipynb](./02_Advanced_Prompting_Techniques.ipynb)**
    *   This notebook explores advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot Prompting, and Tree of Thoughts. It provides interactive examples to help you master these powerful methods for complex analytical tasks.

## How to Use

To get the most out of these notebooks, you should:

1.  **Download the `.ipynb` files** from the links above.
2.  **Run the notebooks in a Jupyter environment** (like JupyterLab or Google Colab).
3.  **Install the necessary libraries:** `ipywidgets` is required for the interactive elements. You can install it with `pip install ipywidgets`.
4.  **Experiment!** Change the prompts, try different inputs, and see how the "LLM" responds.

These notebooks are designed to be a starting point. We encourage you to build on these concepts and apply them to your own work.
