# Simulation: Distressed Workout Negotiation

**Role:** You are a Vice President at a Distressed Debt Hedge Fund.
**Scenario:** You hold $50M face value of Unsecured Notes in "Omega Retail," a struggling brick-and-mortar electronics retailer. The notes are trading at 40 cents on the dollar.
**Objective:** Maximize your recovery. The company is running out of cash.

---

## Phase 1: The Initial Proposal

The Company's advisors (Restructuring Bankers) send a proposal:
*   Exchange your Unsecured Notes for new Second Lien Notes at 60% of face value.
*   Maturity extended by 3 years.
*   Interest rate reduced from 8% cash to 4% cash + 4% PIK (Payment in Kind).

### Decision Point 1
Do you accept this initial proposal?

**A. Accept immediately.**
*   *Outcome:* You lock in a better position than equity, but 60% recovery is low if the company turns around. Plus, reducing cash interest helps the company but hurts your near-term carry.
*   *Score:* 5/10. Too passive.

**B. Reject and form an Ad Hoc Committee.**
*   *Outcome:* You join forces with other large bondholders to negotiate as a block. This gives you leverage to demand better terms or a "seat at the table."
*   *Score:* 9/10. Standard playbook for distressed investors.

**C. Threaten to file an Involuntary Bankruptcy petition.**
*   *Outcome:* Very aggressive. This might force the company to the table, but it could also destroy value by triggering a "free fall" bankruptcy where customers flee.
*   *Score:* 3/10. Too risky at this stage.

## Phase 2: The Counter-Offer

You chose **B**. You form a committee. You discover the company has unencumbered assets (a distribution center) worth $100M.

**Your Committee's Strategy:**
You propose a "New Money" deal.
*   The Committee will lend the company $50M in new super-senior debt (DIP financing if in court, or Priming Debt if out of court) to fund operations.
*   In exchange, your Unsecured Notes roll up into this new Senior Secured facility at 80% face value.

### Decision Point 2
The Company pushes back. They want the new money but refuse to roll up your old debt at 80%. They offer 50%.

**A. Hold the line at 80%.**
*   *Outcome:* Negotiations stall. The company misses an interest payment. Bond prices crash to 20.
*   *Score:* 4/10. Overplayed your hand.

**B. Compromise at 65% plus Warrants.**
*   *Outcome:* You agree to 65% face value in new Senior Debt, but you demand "Penny Warrants" for 20% of the post-restructuring equity. This gives you upside if the company survives.
*   *Score:* 10/10. Smart structuring. You get downside protection (Senior Debt) and upside potential (Equity Warrants).

## Phase 3: The Endgame

The deal is agreed. A "Restructuring Support Agreement" (RSA) is signed. The company executes an out-of-court exchange.

**Result:**
*   You invested $20M (buying notes at 40).
*   You lent $5M new money.
*   Total Invested: $25M.
*   **Outcome:** The company stabilizes. Your new Senior Notes trade at par ($37.5M value). Your warrants are worth $10M.
*   **Total Value:** $47.5M.
*   **Return:** ~90% ROI.

**Key Lesson:** In distressed scenarios, liquidity is king. Providing "New Money" often gives you the leverage to improve the recovery on your "Old Money."
