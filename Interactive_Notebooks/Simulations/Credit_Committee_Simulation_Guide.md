# Simulation: The Distressed Retailer Credit Committee

> **Role:** You are a Senior Credit Analyst at a distressed debt fund.
> **Mission:** Evaluate a $50M Term Loan B request for "FashionForward," a struggling mall-based apparel retailer.
> **Outcome:** You must present your recommendation to the Investment Committee (IC). Approval or Denial?

## Phase 1: The Initial Screen (Triage)

You receive the Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM). Here are the highlights:
*   **Revenue:** $500M (Down 5% YoY).
*   **EBITDA (Adjusted):** $50M (Up 10% YoY due to cost cuts).
*   **Total Debt:** $200M.
*   **Request:** $50M "incremental" loan to fund a digital transformation.
*   **Collateral:** Second lien on Inventory and IP.

**Analyst Calculation:**
Calculate the Leverage Ratio (Total Debt / EBITDA).
$250M (Pro Forma Debt) / $50M EBITDA = **5.0x**.

### Decision Point 1: The EBITDA Quality
You notice the EBITDA includes a $15M "add-back" for "Expected Future Synergies from Store Closures."

**Question:** How do you treat this add-back?

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: Accept it. Management knows their business.</strong></summary>

❌ **Critical Error.**
"Expected" synergies are not cash flow. In a distressed scenario, you never give credit for future cost cuts that haven't happened yet. This artificially lowers the leverage ratio.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: Reject it entirely. Recalculate Leverage.</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct.**
Real EBITDA is $50M - $15M = $35M.
New Leverage: $250M / $35M = **7.1x**.
This is a highly levered, dangerous capital structure for a shrinking business.
</details>

## Phase 2: Collateral Analysis

The company offers a **Second Lien** on Inventory.
*   **Gross Inventory Value:** $100M.
*   **First Lien Debt (ABL):** $60M.

**The Math:**
In a liquidation, inventory rarely sells at cost. Let's assume a **Net Orderly Liquidation Value (NOLV)** of 50%.

*   **Liquidation Value:** $100M * 50% = $50M.
*   **First Lien Claim:** $60M.

### Decision Point 2: Security Coverage

**Question:** Is your $50M Second Lien loan covered by the inventory?

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: Yes, Gross value is $100M.</strong></summary>

❌ **Wrong.** Gross book value is meaningless in bankruptcy.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: No, we are "Under water."</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct.**
The First Lien eats the first $60M. The liquidation value is only $50M. There is **$0** left for the Second Lien. You are effectively an **Unsecured Creditor** disguised as secured.
</details>

## Phase 3: The Indenture Trap

You read the "Permitted Payments" section of the existing credit agreement. It allows the company to "dividend out unlimited amounts from the 'Unrestricted Subsidiaries'."

You discover the company's valuable Brand IP (worth $100M) sits in a subsidiary.

### Decision Point 3: The "J.Crew" Risk

**Question:** What risk does this clause pose?

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: None, dividends are good for shareholders.</strong></summary>

❌ **Irrelevant.** You are a lender, not a shareholder. Dividends leak cash out of the credit box.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: Asset Stripping Risk.</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct.**
The company could designate the IP subsidiary as "Unrestricted," move the IP out of the collateral pool, and borrow against it elsewhere (priming you). This is a classic "J.Crew Trap." You must demand a **"J.Crew Blocker"** clause.
</details>

## Phase 4: Final Recommendation

**Summary of Facts:**
1.  **Leverage:** 7.1x (Real), not 5.0x (Marketing).
2.  **Collateral:** Effectively unsecured (underwater behind ABL).
3.  **Docs:** Weak protection against asset stripping.
4.  **Trend:** Revenue declining.

### Final Decision

**Question:** What is your recommendation to the Investment Committee?

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: Approve the Loan. The yield is 12%!</strong></summary>

💀 **Career Limiting Move.**
You are lending to a dying retailer at 7x leverage with no collateral coverage and weak docs. The 12% yield does not compensate for the high probability of a 50% principal loss (Default).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: Deny / Pass.</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct.**
"The best loans are the ones you don't make." This credit has no margin of safety.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option C: Counter-Offer (The "Vulture" Approach).</strong></summary>

⚠️ **Advanced Strategy.**
"I will fund only if:
1. Yield increases to 15% + Warrants (Equity Upside).
2. We get a First Lien on the Brand IP (not just 2nd lien on inventory).
3. Full document tightening (Blockers included)."
*If they say no, walk away.*
