    "*   **Par Value (Face Value or Principal):** The amount of money that the bond issuer promises to repay at maturity. This is usually $1,000 or $100.\n",
    "*   **Coupon Rate:** The annual interest rate that the bond issuer promises to pay, expressed as a percentage of the par value. \n",
    "*   **Coupon Payment:** The actual amount of interest paid periodically (e.g., semi-annually or annually). Calculated as `(Coupon Rate * Par Value) / Number of Coupon Payments per Year`.\n",
    "*   **Maturity Date:** The date on which the bond issuer must repay the par value to the bondholder.\n",

    "\n",
    "While duration provides a good first-order approximation of a bond's price sensitivity to yield changes, it's a linear measure. However, the actual relationship between a bond's price and its yield is not linear but convex (curved). Convexity measures this curvature."

    "### Limitations of Duration\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration assumes a linear relationship between price changes and yield changes. This approximation is reasonably accurate for small changes in yield. However, for larger yield changes, duration alone can lead to significant errors in predicting price changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   For a **decrease** in yield, duration will **underestimate** the actual price increase.\n",
    "*   For an **increase** in yield, duration will **overestimate** the actual price decrease (i.e., predict a lower price than actual).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the price-yield curve for a typical (option-free) bond is convex, meaning it curves upwards. Positive convexity is generally a desirable trait for a bondholder, as it implies that the actual price increase from a yield drop is larger than predicted by duration, and the actual price decrease from a yield rise is smaller than predicted by duration."

    "A common formula for **Approximate Convexity** is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The convexity measure calculated this way is an annualized figure. A higher convexity number means more curvature and generally implies better price protection against interest rate movements (for option-free bonds).\n",

    "**Note:** The exact analytical formula for convexity is more complex and involves the sum of discounted cash flows weighted by `t(t+1)` or similar terms. The approximation is often used for its simplicity and practical application."

    "### Callable Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "A **callable bond** gives the *issuer* the right, but not the obligation, to redeem (or \"call\") the bond before its scheduled maturity date at a specified call price. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why issue?** Issuers typically call bonds when interest rates have fallen significantly since the bond was issued. They can then re-issue debt at the new, lower interest rate, reducing their borrowing costs.\n",
    "*   **Impact on Bondholder:** Callable bonds are less attractive to bondholders than otherwise identical non-callable bonds because:\n",
    "    *   **Reinvestment Risk:** If the bond is called, the investor receives their principal back earlier than expected and must reinvest it, likely at lower prevailing interest rates.\n",
    "    *   **Price Capping (Negative Convexity):** As interest rates fall, the price of a callable bond will not rise as much as a non-callable bond. The price tends to be capped near the call price because investors anticipate the bond will be called. This phenomenon is often referred to as **negative convexity** at low yield levels. The price-yield curve for a callable bond becomes flatter and may even curve downwards at low yields.\n",

    "The value of a callable bond can be thought of as:\n",

    "### Putable Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "A **putable bond** (or put bond) gives the *bondholder* the right, but not the obligation, to sell the bond back to the issuer before its maturity date at a specified put price on predetermined dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why valuable to bondholder?** Bondholders typically exercise the put option when interest rates have risen significantly since the bond was issued. This allows them to get their principal back and reinvest at higher prevailing rates.\n",
    "*   **Impact on Bondholder:** Putable bonds are more attractive to bondholders than otherwise identical non-putable bonds because:\n",
    "    *   **Protection Against Rising Rates:** The put option provides a floor for the bond's price. As interest rates rise and the bond's price would normally fall, the ability to sell it back at the put price limits the downside risk.\n",
    "    *   **Price Floor Effect:** The price of a putable bond will not fall as much as a non-putable bond when interest rates rise. The price tends to be supported near the put price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a putable bond can be thought of as:\n",

    "\n",
    "When valuing bonds with embedded options, the standard Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) can be misleading because it doesn't account for the possibility of early redemption or sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)** is a more appropriate measure. It is the constant spread that, when added to all the one-period forward rates on the benchmark yield curve (e.g., government bond curve), makes the theoretical price of the bond (calculated using a model that incorporates the option) equal to its current market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A **higher OAS** generally implies a cheaper bond, after adjusting for the option's value.\n",
    "*   Calculating OAS typically involves complex interest rate models (e.g., binomial trees) to value the embedded option under various interest rate scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does not delve into OAS calculations due to their complexity, but it's an important concept to be aware of when dealing with callable or putable bonds."
