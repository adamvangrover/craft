    "## Scenario\n",
    "You are a credit analyst at a Distressed Debt Hedge Fund. You hold $50M of 'ShopMart Inc.' Senior Unsecured Bonds. The company is running out of cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Capital Structure:**\n",
    "*   **Senior Secured Term Loan (Bank Debt):** $200M (First Lien on Inventory/AR)\n",
    "*   **Senior Unsecured Bonds (You):** $150M\n",
    "*   **Equity:** Owned by Private Equity Sponsor\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Proposal\n",
    "The Sponsor has proposed a **Distressed Debt Exchange (DDE)**:\n",
    "1.  Unsecured Bondholders take a 40% haircut (receive 60 cents on the dollar).\n",
    "2.  New debt will be 'Second Lien' (better than Unsecured, worse than Bank Debt).\n",
    "3.  Sponsor injects $20M new equity."
