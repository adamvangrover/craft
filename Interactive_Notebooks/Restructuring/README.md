# Restructuring Negotiation Simulation

## Scenario Overview
You are stepping into the shoes of a **Senior Secured Lender** for a distressed manufacturing company. The company has hit a liquidity wall and is requesting a forbearance agreement while proposing a restructuring plan.

## Key Concepts
*   **Fulcrum Security**: The security class most likely to be converted into equity.
*   **Blocking Position**: Holding enough debt (usually 33.4%) to block a plan of reorganization in bankruptcy.
*   **Cramdown**: Forcing a plan on a dissenting class of creditors.

## Instructions
1.  Launch the notebook.
2.  Review the financial position of the borrower.
3.  Make decisions at key negotiation points (Forbearance, Debt-for-Equity Swap, Liquidation Analysis).
