> **Buy-Side Perspective:** In restructuring, "Control" is the most valuable asset. If you own the "Fulcrum Security" (the debt layer where value breaks), you effectively own the company. This simulation tests your ability to identify the Fulcrum and negotiate a debt-for-equity swap.

# Simulation Guide: The Distressed Retailer

## Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand Priority of Claims:** First Lien vs. Second Lien vs. Unsecured.
2.  **Evaluate a DDE (Distressed Debt Exchange):** Is a haircut better than bankruptcy?
3.  **Game Theory:** Anticipating the moves of the Sponsor (who wants to keep equity) and the Senior Lenders (who want to liquidate).

## How to Run
Open the notebook `Restructuring_Negotiation_Simulation.ipynb` in Jupyter. Use the dropdown menus to make your credit committee decisions.

## Key Concepts
*   **Fulcrum Security:** The class of debt that will likely convert to equity in a restructuring because the company's value falls within its coverage zone.
*   **Cramdown:** When a bankruptcy court forces a plan on dissenting creditors.
*   **Priming:** When new debt is issued with *higher* priority than existing debt (often a point of litigation).
