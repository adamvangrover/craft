To solve this task, apply the following reasoning method:
(Choose ONE of the following)

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Before providing the final answer, think step by step and explain your reasoning process.
- **Self-Consistency:** Generate 3 diverse reasoning paths (chains of thought). Then, analyze them and determine the final answer by taking a majority vote or selecting the most logical conclusion.
