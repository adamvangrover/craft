# Financial Ratio Analysis for Credit Risk

Financial ratio analysis is a cornerstone of quantitative credit analysis. By comparing key metrics over time and against peers, analysts can gain critical insights into a company's financial health and its ability to service debt. This guide focuses on the most important ratios from a creditor's perspective.

## 1. Leverage Ratios

Leverage ratios measure the extent to which a company relies on debt to finance its assets. High leverage increases financial risk.

*   **Net Debt / EBITDA:** This is the most common leverage ratio in credit analysis. It measures how many years of operating cash flow (as proxied by EBITDA) it would take to repay all net debt.
    *   **Formula:** (Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents) / Creditor-Adjusted EBITDA
    *   **Interpretation:** A lower ratio is better. A ratio above 4.0x-5.0x is typically considered high for most industries.

*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** This ratio compares the company's total debt to the amount of capital invested by its owners.
    *   **Formula:** Total Liabilities / Shareholder's Equity
    *   **Interpretation:** A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the company is financed more by debt than by equity.

## 2. Coverage Ratios

Coverage ratios measure a company's ability to meet its debt obligations.

*   **EBITDA / Interest Expense:** This ratio measures how many times a company can cover its interest payments from its operating earnings.
    *   **Formula:** Creditor-Adjusted EBITDA / Cash Interest Expense
    *   **Interpretation:** A higher ratio is better. A ratio below 2.0x is a cause for concern.

*   **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** This is a more comprehensive coverage ratio that includes both interest and principal payments.
    *   **Formula:** (Net Operating Income or FCF before debt service) / (Principal Repayments + Interest Payments)
    *   **Interpretation:** A ratio below 1.0x means the company is not generating enough cash to cover its total debt service.

## 3. Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.

*   **Current Ratio:** This is the most common liquidity ratio.
    *   **Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
    *   **Interpretation:** A ratio above 1.0 suggests the company has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities.

*   **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** This is a more conservative liquidity ratio that excludes inventory from current assets.
    *   **Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
    *   **Interpretation:** This ratio provides a better measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory.

## 4. Profitability Ratios

While profitability is more of a focus for equity investors, it's still important for credit analysts to understand a company's ability to generate sustainable profits.

*   **EBITDA Margin:** This ratio measures a company's operating profitability as a percentage of its revenue.
    *   **Formula:** Creditor-Adjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue
    *   **Interpretation:** A stable or improving EBITDA margin is a positive sign.

*   **Net Profit Margin:** This ratio measures a company's bottom-line profitability.
    *   **Formula:** Net Income / Total Revenue
    *   **Interpretation:** While less important than cash flow for credit analysis, a consistent net profit margin is a sign of a healthy business.

By using these ratios in combination, and by analyzing them over time and against peers, credit analysts can build a robust quantitative picture of a company's credit risk.
