# Writing a Compelling Credit Narrative

A credit narrative is the culmination of your analysis. It's where you bring together all the qualitative and quantitative factors to tell a story about the borrower's creditworthiness and to make a clear, defensible recommendation.

## 1. The Structure of a Credit Narrative

A good credit narrative should have a clear and logical structure. Here is a common framework:

*   **Executive Summary:** Start with a concise summary of your recommendation (approve, decline, or approve with modifications) and the key reasons for your decision.
*   **Borrower and Facility Overview:** Provide a brief overview of the borrower, their business, and the proposed credit facility.
*   **Key Strengths:** Outline the key credit strengths of the borrower. This could include a strong market position, experienced management, stable cash flows, or a valuable collateral package.
*   **Key Risks and Mitigants:** Identify the key credit risks and explain how they are mitigated by the structure of the loan, the borrower's strengths, or other factors.
*   **Financial Analysis:** Summarize your quantitative analysis, including key trends in leverage, coverage, liquidity, and profitability.
*   **Recommendation and Rationale:** Conclude with a detailed recommendation and a clear rationale that ties back to your analysis of the strengths, risks, and mitigants.

## 2. The Principles of Effective Credit Writing

*   **Be Clear and Concise:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon and acronyms where possible. Get straight to the point and make your recommendation clear from the outset.
*   **Be Objective and Unbiased:** Your analysis should be based on the facts, not on your personal feelings or biases. Present both the strengths and the weaknesses of the credit.
*   **Be Persuasive and Defensible:** Your narrative should be a persuasive argument for your recommendation. Use the data and your analysis to support your conclusions. Be prepared to defend your recommendation to senior management or a credit committee.
*   **Tell a Story:** The best credit narratives are not just a collection of facts and figures. They tell a story about the borrower and their business. Use the narrative to bring your analysis to life and to make it more engaging and memorable.

## 3. Example of a Credit Narrative Snippet

Here is an example of how you might summarize the key risks and mitigants in a credit narrative:

"The primary risk in this credit is the cyclicality of the automotive industry. A downturn in the economy could lead to a significant decline in the borrower's revenues and cash flow. This risk is mitigated by several factors:

*   **Strong Balance Sheet:** The borrower has a conservative leverage profile (Net Debt / EBITDA of 2.5x) and a strong liquidity position (Current Ratio of 2.0x).
*   **Experienced Management Team:** The management team has a proven track record of successfully navigating previous industry downturns.
*   **Covenant Package:** The loan agreement includes a leverage covenant (Net Debt / EBITDA < 4.0x) that will provide an early warning signal of any financial deterioration."

By following these principles and this structure, you can write credit narratives that are clear, concise, persuasive, and effective.
