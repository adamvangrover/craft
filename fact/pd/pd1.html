        <div id="part1">
            <h2>Part I: Foundations of Fundamental Credit Risk Evaluation</h2>
            <p>This part establishes the conceptual bedrock of credit analysis, defining the core principles, risks, and analytical frameworks that guide the entire evaluation process. It provides the essential context required before an analyst can begin to deconstruct a company's qualitative profile or quantitative performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="part2">
            <h2>Part II: The Qualitative Assessment: Understanding the Business and its Environment</h2>
            <p>Before diving into the numbers, a credit analyst must first develop a deep, narrative understanding of the business itself and the environment in which it operates. This qualitative assessment provides the essential context for interpreting the financial data.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="part3">
            <h2>Part III: The Quantitative Assessment: A Deep Dive into Financial Health</h2>
            <p>This part forms the quantitative core of the credit evaluation. It involves a meticulous and skeptical dissection of a company's financial statements to uncover the true economic reality of its performance, profitability, and solvency.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="part4">
            <h2>Part IV: Structuring the Deal and Managing Ongoing Risk</h2>
            <p>The culmination of the analytical process is not just a decision to lend, but a recommendation on how to lend. A well-structured credit facility is one where the terms, conditions, and pricing are tailored to the specific risks identified in the qualitative and quantitative analysis.</p>
