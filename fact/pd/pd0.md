SLIDE 1: Company Analysis - Assessing Credit Risk
Credit Analysis evaluates the borrowers ability to meet its financial commitments employing both qualitative and quantitative measures. To analyse a company, we look at various sources of information to get a sense of the credit profile. Regularly used information is listed as follows:
• Principal Sources of Information
	•	﻿﻿Annual Reports, Financial Statements & Management Presentations. For public companies, these can be found on investor relations websites. For private companies we store information on the Listt system.
	•	﻿﻿Investor News: This is gained from subscription to public company news feeds.
	•	﻿﻿External credit rating agency reports: Typically Moody's and S&P reports.
	•	﻿﻿Equity research reports & publications: Access to Bank’s Equity Research and external reports.
	•	﻿﻿Industry reports: Various sources (such as Wood Mackenzie for Natural Resource sector).
	•	﻿﻿Relationship teams: Bank’s relationship teams will have extremely good knowledge of clients.
	•	﻿﻿General news & press: We would check general media for signs of bad press or other concerns.
• Key Risks Areas:
	•	﻿﻿Business & financial risk (e.g. company specific)
	•	﻿﻿Industry / sector risk (e.g. industry specific)
	•	﻿﻿Macroeconomic risks (e.g. universal)
 
SLIDE 2: Company Analysis - Business Risks
• Company: Business risks are potential weaknesses in a companies business profile, industry or operations. These risks vary considerably by industry. Below are some of the questions we would ask when looking at a business:
	•	﻿﻿Is the business cyclical? I.e. does the performance of the business trend with CDP cycles?
	•	﻿﻿What are the long term supply/demand structural factors in the industry? Is the market declining or growing? Does the group benefit from geographical, product or asset diversification? Are assets focussed in countries of high political or default risk?
	•	﻿﻿Is the business small or large versus peers and is there significant competition in the market? Is there risk of adverse litigation? (e.g. pharmaceutical companies). Is there a risk of technological advancement causing market disruption (e.g. Iphone)? How large is the supplier base, what is the track record and how established are the relationships? What is the credit quality of its customers, where are they located? Is there any customer concentration?
 
SLIDE 3: Company Analysis - Ownership and Management
Ownership/Management: An appropriate ownership structure and a strong, experienced management team with depth of talent are key to a successful business. We would consider the following factors when looking at a client:
	•	﻿﻿What is the ownership structure (e.g. sovereign owned, publicly listed, hedge fund, private equity, family owned, joint venture). How would this affect the company's ability to operate, make decisions or raise capital?
	•	﻿﻿Is the company considered to be management dominated or has any particular dependence on individuals? This could be negative if that individual left for any reason (e.g. sickness) or the objectives of the individual did not align with the company or creditors/lenders. Are there any succession issues?
	•	﻿﻿What is management's track record in strategy execution and reputation within the market? Is management experience relevant for roles occupied?
	•	﻿﻿Is management governance and accountability strong within the group? E.g. CEO and chairman roles occupied by different individuals.

	•	﻿﻿How established is the regulation? What is the historic track record/ general trends seen in regulatory decisions?
• Markets
	•	﻿﻿Foreign exchange, commodity prices (e.g. oil price, electricity price, gas price, copper, rare metals)
	•	﻿﻿Can products be hedged?
 
SLIDE 6: Company Analysis - Financial Performance
Financial analysis of a company would include a wider range of considerations, summarised below:
	•	﻿﻿Quality of earnings from income statement considering key drivers (e.g. volumes, price, cost management)
	•	﻿﻿Quality of cash flow from cash flow statement, showing underlying cash performance
	•	﻿﻿Asset & debt structure from balance sheet considering leverage, asset mix, off-balance sheet items)
	•	﻿﻿Liquidity (sources and uses, debt maturity profile)
	•	﻿﻿Forecast analysis (assumptions made, trends, whether realistic etc.)
	•	﻿﻿Sensitivity analysis (downside scenario covering off key risks to a business e.g. plant shut down or cyclicality)
	•	﻿﻿The overall financial strategy of the group and whether appropriate:
> Reinvest through acquisition/ expansion
> Preserve liquidity
> Prepay debt
> Pay dividend/repurchase shares
• Analysis is summarised in credit papers highlighting Key Financial Risks
 
SLIDE 7: Company Analysis - Income Statement
	•	﻿﻿A financial statement that measures a company's financial performance over a specific period. Also known as the Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement.
	•	﻿﻿Credit Focus:
	•	﻿﻿Revenue, analysing the key drivers and historical changes. This gives a sense of companies overall activity and is driven by factors such as volume, price, FX movements etc. How do these compare with the industry trends?
	•	﻿﻿Gross profit, in particular how do the costs of goods sold affect the profitability of the firm? What is the trend?
	•	﻿﻿Operating expenditure levels, help assess how efficient the company is, in particular when compared with its peers. How does this affect the breakeven output/price level of the firm? How much is within the control of the company's management.
	•	﻿﻿EBITDA is a measure of a company's underlying profitability, ignoring funding structure, tax and capital requirements. It is used as a comparable proxy for cash flow which is used in a variety of credit ratios, most importantly leverage. See next slide for more information.
 
SLIDE 8: Company Analysis - EBITDA
• EBITDA can be used as a proxy for company performance. This is because: -
	•	﻿﻿Helps to remove the bias of the specific company's capital structure, depreciation and tax policies
	•	﻿﻿Remains relatively unaffected from various potential non-recurring items such as restructuring, impairments and gains/losses from asset disposals.
	•	﻿﻿Allows for an quick high-level comparison between historical company performance and across selected peer group.
	•	﻿﻿Whilst EBITDA is one of the most useful metrics, there can often be differences in how companies or research analysts calculate this. We must take care when calculating EBITDA to ensure it represents the underlying cash flow profitability of the business as closely as possible and may mean adjustments to company or research analysts figures.
	•	﻿﻿EBITDA is used in a variety of metrics and financial covenants with key ratios being Net Leverage: Net Debt / EBTIDA and Interest Cover: EBTIDA / Cash Interest.
 
SLIDE 9: Company Analysis - Balance Sheet Statement
	•	﻿﻿A balance sheet is a financial statement that summarises a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders equity at a specific point in time.
	•	﻿﻿Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity
	•	﻿﻿Credit Focus:
	•	﻿﻿Working capital - This comprises trade receivables plus inventories minus trade payables. Working capital gives an idea of day-to-day funding requirements and cash conversion cycle.
	•	﻿﻿Ratios - Provide information on liquidity of balance sheet and turnover of capital (i.e. current & quick ratios, asset turnover).
	•	﻿﻿Capital structure - How is the business funded (e.g. debt vs. equity)? What is the company's funding strategy (both long and short-term)?
	•	﻿﻿Liquidity - What is the firm's ability to meet its short term obligations (<12 months)? Does it have any committed undrawn back-up liquidity facilities?
	•	﻿﻿Off-balance sheet liabilities - Present in the notes of the Financial information (i.e. operating leases, contingencies, commitments).
	•	﻿﻿Are assets mainly tangible (e.g. property) or intangible? Current or non-current? Is the group 'asset-lite' or asset heavy?
 
SLIDE 10: Company Analysis - Cash Flow Statement
	•	﻿﻿The statement represents all cash inflows a company receives from both its ongoing operations and external investment sources, as well as all cash outflows that pay for business activities and investments during a given timeframe.
	•	﻿﻿Credit Focus:
	•	﻿﻿Operating cash flow, and free cash flow, in particular assessing quantum vs. debt, reliability and sustainability. Ratios such as FFO/Net Debt, OCF/Net Debt).
	•	﻿﻿Significant changes in working capital, and historic trends. Is the business considered cash generative?
	•	﻿﻿Capital expenditure - Maintenance vs. Growth. How much could be considered discretionary spending?
	•	﻿﻿Shareholder policy: i) Does the company have a stated dividend policy? (ii) How sustainable are historic distributions? (ili) How committed are management to maintaining/increasing pay-out ratios?
	•	﻿﻿Net cash flow, in particular trends over the last few years. What are the key drivers? How is this influenced by changing debt quantum?
 
SLIDE 11: Company Analysis - Net Debt Adjustments
	•	﻿﻿Net debt is total debt minus cash balances. This is the total financial liabilities outstanding after cash. Adjustments are made to net debt to include off-balance sheet, debt-like items to give a better idea of overall lability position.
	•	﻿﻿Adjusted net debt could include the following possible adjustments: (+) Contingent liabilities (usually present in the notes of the Annual Financial Statements) (+) Operating leases (usually present in the notes or capitalised at 8x annual rent expense) (+) Net Pension Obligation (can be present in either balance sheet or notes) (+) Net Decommissioning Obligations (+) Net Land Recovery/Dismantling Obligations
 
SLIDE 12: Company Analysis - Financial Ratios
	•	﻿﻿Useful for comparison of entities, which links together all three financial statements.
	•	﻿﻿Key tips:
	•	﻿﻿Avoid analysing ratio levels in isolation
	•	﻿﻿Select ratios' based on relevance, in particular bearing consideration to the company and industry characteristics
	•	﻿﻿Compare to historical trends, in addition to the industry norms
	•	﻿﻿Compare to selected peers, by undertaking a peer analysis
	•	﻿﻿Consider if a ratio may be subject to manipulation by the borrower (e.g. window dressing)
	•	﻿﻿Primary Ratios:
	•	﻿﻿Profitability Ratios - Measure the firms ability to earn an adequate return
	•	﻿﻿Liquidity Ratios - These ratios measure a firm's ability to meet its short-term obligations
	•	﻿﻿Solvency Ratios - Measure a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations
 
SLIDE 13: Company Analysis - Covenants
	•	﻿﻿Loan documentation contains provisions which are intended to protect lenders in the event of a deterioration in the borrower's perceived credit quality.
	•	﻿﻿Affirmative: Require borrower to perform certain action such as maintain insurance, continue in the same line of business, maintain assets.
	•	﻿﻿Negative: Limits borrower to take certain action such as limitation on debt, dividends, liens, disposition of assets, merger, prepayments, transactions.
	•	﻿﻿Financial: Require borrower to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios.
	•	﻿﻿Maintenance financial covenants: Maintain a designated credit profile through compliance with certain financial ratios.
	•	﻿﻿Incurrence financial covenants: Prevent issuer from taking a specific action (such as incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments) unless it is in pro-forma compliance with a ratio test.
	•	﻿﻿Springing financial covenant: Tested only under specific scenario, for example if a facility is 25% drawn.
 
SLIDE 14: Company Analysis - Financial Covenants
Financial Covenants can form an important part of the conditions of a loan agreement. These are promises by the management of the borrowing firm to adhere to certain limits in the firm's operations.
• Common examples:
	•	﻿﻿Leverage covenant - a maximum permitted Net Debt / EBITDA multiple (e.g. 3x)
	•	﻿﻿Interest Cover Ratio - a minimum permitted Net Interest Expense (or cash interest) / EBIT (or EBITDA) multiple (e.g. 3x)
	•	﻿﻿Debt to Equity Covenant - maximum permitted debt / book equity percentage (e.g. 100%)
	•	﻿﻿Debt to Capitalisation Covenant - maximum permitted debt / book capitalisation (e.g. 60%)
	•	﻿﻿Loan to value covenant (LTV) - used where security is present and caps maximum debt to security value (e.g. 60%)
	•	﻿﻿Debt Service Cover Ratio (DSCR) - minimum free cash flow to debt service including repayments and interest (e.g. 1.25x)
	•	﻿﻿Maximum capital expenditure - maximum permitted capital expenditure versus budget (e.g. 110%)
• A strong investment grade borrower may have 1 or no covenants whereas a sub-investment grade borrower would usually have 3 or more covenants.
 
 
SLIDE 15: Company Analysis - Negative Covenants
	•	﻿﻿Provisions that limits the borrower's ability to take certain actions. Some key general undertakings include:
	•	﻿﻿Negative pledge: A clause which prohibits a party from creating any security interests over certain assets specified in the document. Often subject to a minimum threshold
	•	﻿﻿Restrictions on disposals: Often subject to a minimum threshold and various carve outs ("baskets")
	•	﻿﻿Restrictions on acquisitions: Often subject to a minimum threshold and various carve outs ("baskets")
	•	﻿﻿Financial indebtedness: A limitation on the level of guarantees or indebtedness that can be placed (in particular at subsidiary level)
	•	﻿﻿Event of default (see next slide)
 
SLIDE 16: Company Analysis - Events of Default (EoD)
	•	﻿﻿Provisions that if breached could cause the borrower to default. A default allows the lenders to accelerate the loan and demand full repayment. Some key covenants include:
	•	﻿﻿Non-payment: The borrower fails to pay an amount payable when due pursuant to a 'finance document.
	•	﻿﻿Breach of financial covenant: If the borrower fails to meet its agreed financial covenants
	•	﻿﻿Cross default: provision which puts a borrower in default if the borrower defaults on another obligation (usually subject to a defined) threshold
	•	﻿﻿Cross acceleration: similar to cross default, except is only triggered if another lender actually calls a default/accelerates. Take care as this clause can still be defined as a cross default in a loan agreement
	•	﻿﻿Change of control: any change in ownership of more than x% of the shareholding/voting capital stock of a Party (usually in respect of the ownership of the group parent).
	•	﻿﻿Maintenance of ownership: The borrower must maintain [x]% ownership in certain subsidiaries (e.g. material subsidiaries)
	•	﻿﻿Material adverse change: A clause to protect the bank from major changes that may happen which makes funding less attractive. Often interchangeable with Material Adverse Effect
