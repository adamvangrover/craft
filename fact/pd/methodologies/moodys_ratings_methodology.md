# Moody's Investors Service Methodology: A Deep Dive

Moody's Investors Service is another key player in the credit rating industry. Their methodologies, while sharing some similarities with S&P's, have their own distinct features and areas of emphasis. This guide provides a detailed look at Moody's framework for rating corporate issuers.

## 1. Moody's Rating Scale

Moody's uses a similar letter-based rating scale to S&P, but with some notational differences.

*   **Investment Grade:**
    *   **Aaa:** Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal credit risk.
    *   **Aa:** Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.
    *   **A:** Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.
    *   **Baa:** Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.

*   **Speculative Grade (Junk):**
    *   **Ba:** Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk.
    *   **B:** Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
    *   **Caa:** Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.
    *   **Ca:** Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.
    *   **C:** Obligations rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.

Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.

## 2. The Moody's Analytical Framework

Moody's rating methodology is built around a scorecard-based approach that combines a number of qualitative and quantitative factors. The framework is designed to be forward-looking and to assess the long-term sustainability of a company's credit profile.

The key components of Moody's framework are:

1.  **Business Profile:** An assessment of the company's industry, competitive position, and scale.
2.  **Financial Profile:** A detailed analysis of the company's financial statements, with a focus on leverage, coverage, and financial policy.
3.  **Scorecard:** The business and financial profiles are combined in a scorecard to generate an indicative rating.
4.  **Qualitative Adjustments:** The scorecard rating is then adjusted for a variety of qualitative factors, including management quality, corporate governance, and event risk.
5.  **Final Rating:** The adjusted rating becomes the final issuer credit rating.

### 2.1 Business Profile

Moody's assessment of a company's business profile is based on four main factors:

*   **Industry Fundamentals:** An analysis of the industry's growth prospects, competitive dynamics, and cyclicality.
*   **Market Position:** An assessment of the company's competitive advantages, brand strength, and market share.
*   **Scale:** Moody's considers the company's size and diversification, as larger, more diversified companies are generally considered to be less risky.
*   **Business Model:** An evaluation of the company's strategy, operational effectiveness, and the sustainability of its business model.

### 2.2 Financial Profile

Moody's financial profile assessment is based on a number of key financial metrics, which are grouped into three main categories:

*   **Leverage and Coverage:** This is the core of the financial analysis. Moody's uses a variety of ratios to assess a company's debt burden and its ability to service that debt.
*   **Financial Policy:** Moody's assesses the company's financial policy, including its approach to risk management, its dividend policy, and its track record of financial stewardship.
*   **Liquidity:** An analysis of the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.

## 3. Moody's Analytical Adjustments

Like S&P, Moody's makes a number of standard adjustments to a company's reported financial statements to provide a more accurate picture of its financial health.

### 3.1 Adjustments to Earnings

Moody's focuses on a variety of earnings metrics, including EBITDA, EBITA, and Retained Cash Flow (RCF). They make a number of adjustments to these metrics to remove non-recurring items and to better reflect the company's underlying profitability.

### 3.2 Adjustments to Debt

Moody's "Adjusted Debt" is a broad measure of a company's total liabilities. It includes all on-balance sheet debt as well as a number of off-balance sheet and debt-like items. Common adjustments include:

*   **Adding:**
    *   Operating leases
    *   Unfunded pension obligations
    *   Guarantees
    *   Securitized receivables sold

## 4. Key Financial Ratios

Moody's uses a scorecard approach that combines a number of key financial ratios. The following table provides a summary of some of the most important ratios and their typical weighting in the scorecard.

| Ratio                      | Formula                               | Typical Weighting |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Leverage Ratios**        |                                       |                   |
| Debt / EBITDA              | Adjusted Debt / Adjusted EBITDA       | 20-30%            |
| RCF / Net Debt             | Retained Cash Flow / Adjusted Net Debt| 10-20%            |
| **Coverage Ratios**        |                                       |                   |
| (EBITDA - Capex) / Interest| (Adj. EBITDA - Capex) / Interest Exp. | 10-20%            |
| **Profitability Ratios**   |                                       |                   |
| EBITA / Assets             | Adjusted EBITA / Average Assets       | 10-15%            |

**Note:** The specific ratios and weightings will vary depending on the industry.

## 5. Industry-Specific Considerations

Moody's has detailed, industry-specific methodologies that provide a more nuanced view of credit risk. These methodologies include specific scorecards and financial ratio benchmarks for each industry. For example:

*   **Airlines:** Moody's analysis of airlines focuses on factors such as fleet age, route network, and sensitivity to fuel prices.
*   **Pharmaceuticals:** For pharmaceutical companies, Moody's pays close attention to patent expirations, drug pipelines, and regulatory risk.
*   **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):** Moody's analysis of REITs emphasizes property portfolio quality, occupancy rates, and access to capital.

A thorough understanding of Moody's industry-specific methodologies is essential for any analyst covering a particular sector. These are typically available on Moody's website.

By understanding the nuances of the Moody's framework and their scorecard-based approach, credit analysts can gain a deeper insight into a company's creditworthiness and make more informed investment decisions.
