# S&P Global Ratings Methodology: A Deep Dive

S&P Global Ratings is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics. A deep understanding of their methodology is crucial for any credit analyst. This guide provides a detailed breakdown of S&P's framework for rating corporate issuers.

## 1. S&P Rating Scale

S&P uses a letter-based credit rating scale to convey its opinion of a borrower's creditworthiness. The scale ranges from 'AAA' (highest) to 'D' (default).

*   **Investment Grade:**
    *   **AAA:** Extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments.
    *   **AA:** Very strong capacity to meet financial commitments.
    *   **A:** Strong capacity to meet financial commitments, but somewhat more susceptible to adverse economic conditions.
    *   **BBB:** Adequate capacity to meet financial commitments, but more subject to adverse economic conditions.

*   **Speculative Grade (Junk):**
    *   **BB:** Less vulnerable in the near-term but faces major ongoing uncertainties.
    *   **B:** More vulnerable to adverse business, financial, and economic conditions, but currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments.
    *   **CCC:** Currently vulnerable and dependent on favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet financial commitments.
    *   **CC:** Currently highly vulnerable.
    *   **C:** A bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken, but payments on this obligation are being continued.
    *   **D:** In default or in breach of an imputed promise.

S&P may also add a plus (+) or minus (-) to ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

## 2. The S&P Analytical Framework

S&P's corporate rating methodology is a comprehensive framework that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis. The process can be broken down into several key steps:

1.  **Business Risk Profile:** An assessment of the company's industry, competitive position, and management.
2.  **Financial Risk Profile:** An analysis of the company's financial statements, with a focus on cash flow and leverage.
3.  **Anchor:** The business and financial risk profiles are combined to determine an "anchor" rating.
4.  **Modifiers:** The anchor is then adjusted for factors such as diversification, capital structure, financial policy, liquidity, and management and governance.
5.  **Final Rating:** The modified anchor results in the stand-alone credit profile (SACP), which is then adjusted for any group or government influence to arrive at the final issuer credit rating.

### 2.1 Business Risk Profile

S&P's assessment of a company's business risk profile is based on three main factors:

*   **Industry Risk:** S&P assesses the risk of the industry in which the company operates, considering factors such as cyclicality, competitive intensity, barriers to entry, and growth prospects.
*   **Country Risk:** This assesses the economic, political, and financial system risks of the countries where the company operates.
*   **Competitive Position:** This is a detailed analysis of the company's specific strengths and weaknesses, including its market share, brand equity, cost structure, and operational efficiency.

### 2.2 Financial Risk Profile

S&P's analysis of a company's financial risk profile is primarily based on two key areas:

*   **Cash Flow/Leverage:** This is the core of the financial risk assessment. S&P uses a variety of metrics to assess a company's cash flow generation and its ability to service its debt.
*   **Financial Policy:** S&P assesses the company's financial policy, including its attitude toward risk, its funding and liquidity management, and its dividend and share buyback policies.

## 3. S&P's Analytical Adjustments

S&P makes a number of analytical adjustments to a company's reported financial statements to create a more comparable and economically accurate picture of its financial performance. These adjustments are crucial for understanding a company's true credit risk.

### 3.1 Adjustments to EBITDA

S&P's "Creditor-Adjusted EBITDA" is a key metric in their analysis. It starts with reported EBITDA and then makes a series of adjustments to remove non-recurring items and to better reflect the company's underlying cash flow. Common adjustments include:

*   **Adding back:**
    *   Non-recurring restructuring costs
    *   Non-cash stock-based compensation
*   **Subtracting:**
    *   Gains on asset sales
    *   Other non-recurring income

### 3.2 Adjustments to Debt

S&P's "Adjusted Net Debt" is a comprehensive measure of a company's total indebtedness. It includes all on-balance sheet debt as well as a number of off-balance sheet and debt-like items. Common adjustments include:

*   **Adding:**
    *   The present value of operating lease obligations
    *   Unfunded pension obligations
    *   Asset retirement obligations
    *   Contingent liabilities (e.g., guarantees)

## 4. Key Financial Ratios

S&P uses a variety of financial ratios to assess a company's creditworthiness. The following table provides a summary of some of the most important ratios and the typical ranges for different rating categories.

| Ratio                      | Formula                                            | Investment Grade (BBB- or higher) | Speculative Grade (BB+ or lower) |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Leverage Ratios**        |                                                    |                                   |                                  |
| Net Debt / EBITDA          | Adjusted Net Debt / Adjusted EBITDA                | < 4.0x                            | > 4.0x                           |
| FFO / Net Debt             | Funds from Operations / Adjusted Net Debt          | > 20%                             | < 20%                            |
| **Coverage Ratios**        |                                                    |                                   |                                  |
| EBITDA / Interest Expense  | Adjusted EBITDA / Cash Interest Expense            | > 4.0x                            | < 4.0x                           |
| FOCF / Debt                | Free Operating Cash Flow / Adjusted Debt           | > 10%                             | < 10%                            |

**Note:** These are general guidelines and the actual ranges will vary depending on the industry and the specific company.

## 5. Industry-Specific Considerations

S&P's rating methodology is not a "one-size-fits-all" approach. They have specific criteria and benchmarks for different industries to reflect the unique risks and characteristics of each sector. For example:

*   **Utilities:** S&P's analysis of utilities focuses on the regulatory environment, the company's asset base, and its financial policies.
*   **Retail:** For retailers, S&P pays close attention to competitive positioning, inventory management, and the impact of e-commerce.
*   **Technology:** In the tech sector, S&P's analysis emphasizes innovation, product cycles, and the "stickiness" of the company's customer base.

A thorough understanding of S&P's industry-specific methodologies is essential for any analyst covering a particular sector. These are typically available on S&P's website.

By combining a deep understanding of the S&P framework with a rigorous analysis of the company's financials and a nuanced view of the industry, credit analysts can develop a well-informed and defensible opinion of a company's creditworthiness.
