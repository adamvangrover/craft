## 2. Calculating Adjusted Net Debt and Creditor-Adjusted EBITDA

A key part of quantitative analysis is making adjustments to a company's reported financial statements to get a more accurate picture of its financial health. Here is a step-by-step guide to calculating adjusted net debt and creditor-adjusted EBITDA.

### 2.1 Creditor-Adjusted EBITDA

1.  **Start with Reported EBITDA:** Begin with the company's reported EBITDA.
2.  **Add Back Non-Recurring Expenses:** Add back any one-time or non-recurring expenses, such as restructuring charges or legal settlements.
3.  **Subtract Non-Recurring Gains:** Subtract any one-time or non-recurring gains, such as gains on asset sales.
4.  **Add Back Non-Cash Expenses:** Add back any non-cash expenses, such as stock-based compensation.
5.  **Make Other Adjustments:** Make any other adjustments that are necessary to get a more accurate picture of the company's underlying cash flow.

### 2.2 Adjusted Net Debt

1.  **Start with Total Debt:** Begin with the company's total on-balance sheet debt.
2.  **Add Off-Balance Sheet Debt:** Add any off-balance sheet debt, such as operating leases or securitized receivables.
3.  **Add Other Debt-Like Items:** Add any other debt-like items, such as unfunded pension obligations or asset retirement obligations.
4.  **Subtract Cash and Equivalents:** Subtract the company's cash and cash equivalents.

## 3. Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis

Sensitivity and scenario analysis are powerful tools for assessing a company's financial resilience.

*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** This involves changing a single key assumption (e.g., interest rates, commodity prices) to see how it affects a company's financial performance.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** This involves changing multiple assumptions at the same time to model the impact of a specific event (e.g., a recession, the loss of a major customer).

By using these advanced techniques, you can get a better understanding of the key risks facing a company and how it would perform in a variety of different scenarios. This will allow you to make more informed and defensible credit decisions.
