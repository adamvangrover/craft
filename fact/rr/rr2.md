# Understanding Loan Covenants

Loan covenants are a critical component of credit agreements. They are promises made by the borrower to the lender, and they are designed to protect the lender by providing an early warning system of any potential financial deterioration.

## 1. Types of Covenants

There are three main types of covenants:

*   **Affirmative Covenants:** These require the borrower to take certain actions. Common affirmative covenants include requirements to:
    *   Provide timely financial statements.
    *   Maintain adequate business insurance.
    *   Pay all taxes and other government charges when due.
    *   Maintain properties and assets in good working order.

*   **Negative Covenants:** These prohibit or limit the borrower from taking certain actions without the lender's consent. Common negative covenants include limitations on:
    *   Incurring additional debt.
    *   Pledging assets to other creditors (negative pledge).
    *   Selling or disposing of assets.
    *   Paying dividends or making other distributions to shareholders.
    *   Merging with or acquiring other companies.

*   **Financial Covenants:** These require the borrower to maintain certain financial ratios. They are the quantitative tripwires that provide an objective measure of a borrower's financial health. Common financial covenants include:
    *   **Leverage Covenant:** A maximum permitted Net Debt / EBITDA ratio.
    *   **Interest Coverage Covenant:** A minimum permitted EBITDA / Cash Interest ratio.
    *   **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** A minimum ratio of cash flow available for debt service to total debt service obligations.
    *   **Capital Expenditure (Capex) Limit:** A maximum permitted amount of capital expenditure in a fiscal year.

## 2. Maintenance vs. Incurrence Covenants

The way covenants are tested also has a significant impact on the level of protection they provide to the lender.

*   **Maintenance Covenants:** These covenants must be tested on a regular basis (typically quarterly). If the borrower fails the test, it is an immediate event of default. This provides the strongest protection for lenders and is the standard for most bank loans.

*   **Incurrence Covenants:** These covenants are only tested when the borrower wants to take a specific action, such as incurring more debt or paying a dividend. The borrower can have deteriorating financial ratios and not be in default as long as they don't take one of these actions. This provides less protection for lenders and is more common in high-yield bonds.

## 3. The Importance of Covenants

Covenants are a critical tool for managing credit risk. They provide an early warning system that allows lenders to take action before a borrower's financial condition deteriorates to the point of default. A well-structured covenant package can significantly reduce the risk of a loan and is a hallmark of a prudent lending decision.
