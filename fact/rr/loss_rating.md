# Loss Rating Profile

## I. Definition

Assets classified as "Loss" are considered uncollectible and possess such minimal value that their continued recognition as bankable assets is unwarranted. This classification does not imply the complete absence of any recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is impractical or undesirable to defer writing off an asset that is fundamentally worthless.

## II. Key Characteristics and Criteria

- **All characteristics of a Doubtful credit are present, but with no realistic prospect of improvement.**
- **Uncollectible:** The loan is considered to be uncollectible.
- **No Value:** The asset has little or no salvage value.
- **Write-Off:** The asset is written off in the period it is deemed to be a loss.

## III. Quantitative and Qualitative Indicators

### Quantitative
- **Financials:** The borrower is typically in bankruptcy or has ceased operations.
- **Valuation:** The value of the collateral is negligible, or the bank's claim is subordinate to other creditors.

### Qualitative
- **Borrower Status:** The borrower is in liquidation or has been dissolved.
- **Fraud:** In some cases, a loss classification may be triggered by fraud or other illegal acts by the borrower.

## IV. Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: Fraudulent Company
A company is found to have been engaged in a massive accounting fraud. The company's financial statements are completely unreliable, and its assets are worthless. The company files for bankruptcy, and the lenders are expected to recover nothing. The loan is classified as a Loss.

### Example 2: Unsecured Loan to a Failed Business
A bank makes an unsecured loan to a small business. The business fails and ceases operations. The owner of the business has no personal assets and declares bankruptcy. The bank has no source of repayment and the loan is classified as a Loss.

## V. Common Triggers for This Rating

- **Bankruptcy or Liquidation:** The borrower files for bankruptcy or is liquidated.
- **Fraud:** The discovery of fraud or other illegal acts by the borrower.
- **No Source of Repayment:** A determination that there is no realistic source of repayment.

## VI. Post-Loss Actions

- **Charge-Off:** The loan is charged off against the bank's allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).
- **Recovery Efforts:** The bank may continue to pursue recovery efforts, but these are typically handled by a specialized workout group or an outside collection agency. Any recoveries are recorded as income.
