# Substandard Non-Accrual Rating Profile

## I. Definition

A "Substandard" asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by any collateral pledged. Such assets must exhibit a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by a distinct possibility that the bank will incur some loss if the identified deficiencies are not corrected.

A Substandard loan is placed on **non-accrual status** when the accrual of interest has been suspended because the borrower has failed to make interest or principal payments for a specified period of time. A loan is typically placed on non-accrual status when it is 90 days or more past due, or when the full collection of principal and interest is not expected.

## II. Key Characteristics and Criteria

- **All characteristics of a Substandard Accrual credit are present.**
- **Payment Default:** The borrower has missed one or more scheduled interest or principal payments and is typically 90 days or more past due.
- **Inability to Pay:** The bank has determined that the borrower does not have the ability to make future interest and principal payments.
- **Deterioration:** The borrower's financial condition has deteriorated to the point where the collection of all contractual principal and interest is no longer reasonably assured.

## III. Quantitative and Qualitative Indicators

### Quantitative
- **Delinquency:** 90+ days past due on interest or principal.
- **Financials:** Severe and sustained operating losses, negative cash flow, and a deeply distressed balance sheet.
- **Valuation:** The value of the collateral is less than the loan balance, and there is a high probability of a loss.

### Qualitative
- **Communication:** The borrower is not communicating with the bank or is not cooperative.
- **Turnaround Plan:** There is no viable turnaround plan, or the plan has failed.
- **Bankruptcy:** The borrower may be considering or has already filed for bankruptcy protection.

## IV. Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: Retailer
A brick-and-mortar retailer has been struggling for years with declining sales and profitability. The company has high leverage and has been in violation of its covenants for some time. The company has now missed several interest payments and is over 90 days past due. The bank has placed the loan on non-accrual status and is considering its legal options.

### Example 2: Transportation Company
A trucking company has been hit hard by a sharp increase in fuel prices and a decline in freight volumes. The company is unprofitable and has a high debt burden. The company has missed its last two interest payments and is now 60 days past due. The bank has determined that the company will not be able to make its next payment and has placed the loan on non-accrual status.

## V. Common Triggers for Upgrade or Downgrade

- **Upgrade to Substandard Accrual:** The borrower brings the loan current and demonstrates the ability to make future payments. This often requires a significant improvement in financial performance or an injection of new capital.
- **Downgrade to Doubtful:** The collection of the loan in full becomes highly questionable and improbable. This may be triggered by a failed asset sale, a deepening of the borrower's financial distress, or a determination that the collateral value is less than previously thought.
- **Downgrade to Loss:** The loan is deemed to be uncollectible. This may be triggered by a bankruptcy filing, a liquidation of the borrower, or a determination that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
