# Doubtful Rating Profile

## I. Definition

A "Doubtful" asset exhibits all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard classification, with the additional characteristic that these weaknesses render collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

The key distinction between Substandard and Doubtful is the probability of loss. While a Substandard asset has a "distinct possibility" of loss, a Doubtful asset has a "high probability" of loss. However, its classification as an outright loss is deferred because of specific, identifiable pending events that may have a realistic and positive impact on the asset.

## II. Key Characteristics and Criteria

- **All characteristics of a Substandard credit are present.**
- **High Probability of Loss:** The probability of sustaining a loss is high, but there is a pending event that could improve the situation.
- **Pending Event:** There is a specific, identifiable pending event that has a realistic chance of improving the asset's value. Examples include:
    - A pending merger or acquisition.
    - A planned capital injection.
    - The orderly liquidation of collateral.
    - A refinancing that is in process.
- **Uncertainty:** The outcome of the pending event is uncertain.

## III. Quantitative and Qualitative Indicators

### Quantitative
- **Financials:** The borrower is typically in default, with severe and sustained operating losses and a deeply distressed balance sheet.
- **Valuation:** The value of the collateral is less than the loan balance, but there is a pending event that could increase its value.

### Qualitative
- **Pending Event:** The pending event is well-documented and has a reasonable chance of success.
- **Timing:** The pending event is expected to occur in the near future.
- **Borrower Viability:** The borrower is often not a going concern, and the focus is on maximizing recovery from the liquidation of assets.

## IV. Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: Pharmaceutical Company
A development-stage pharmaceutical company has a promising drug in late-stage clinical trials. However, the company has run out of money and is in default on its loan. The company is in the process of being acquired by a larger pharmaceutical company, which would result in a full recovery for the lenders. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, which is uncertain. The loan is rated Doubtful pending the outcome of the regulatory review.

### Example 2: Commercial Real Estate
A loan is secured by a large, vacant office building. The borrower is in default, and the value of the building is less than the loan balance. However, the borrower is in negotiations with a large tenant to lease a significant portion of the building. If the lease is signed, it would significantly increase the value of the building and could lead to a full recovery for the lenders. The loan is rated Doubtful pending the outcome of the lease negotiations.

## V. Common Triggers for Upgrade or Downgrade

- **Upgrade to Substandard or Pass:** The pending event occurs and results in a significant improvement in the asset's value.
- **Downgrade to Loss:** The pending event does not occur, or it does not result in a significant improvement in the asset's value. At this point, the loan is deemed to be uncollectible and is written off.
