### **Executive Summary**

A comprehensive analysis of regulatory guidance on rating credit risk reveals a detailed and structured methodology for assessing and managing credit risk within financial institutions.1 This framework is crucial for ensuring their safety and soundness. At its heart, credit risk is the primary financial risk for banks, and its accurate and timely rating is the foundation of effective management.1

A well-structured credit risk rating system serves multiple critical functions, from informing credit approval and loan pricing to guiding portfolio management and determining capital adequacy.1 Regulatory bodies expect these systems to be comprehensive, accurate, and independently validated, with clear board oversight.1

The evaluation of credit risk is a forward-looking exercise focused on the borrower's capacity to repay debt over the next 12 months, analyzing both quantitative financial data and qualitative factors like management quality.1 Regulators use a common scale for problem credits: **Special Mention (SM)** for potential weaknesses, **Substandard (SS)** for well-defined weaknesses, **Doubtful (D)** when collection is improbable, and **Loss (L)** for uncollectible assets.1

For the largest and most complex syndicated loans, the **Shared National Credit (SNC) Program** provides a consistent, interagency approach to risk rating. Jointly run by the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC, the SNC program assesses credits of $100 million or more shared by three or more institutions, assigning a uniform rating that is binding on all participants.1 This program is a critical tool for monitoring and mitigating systemic risk in the U.S. banking system.1 This guide provides a detailed examination of these principles, processes, and the mechanics of the SNC program.


Detailed Guide to Determining Regulatory Risk Ratings and the Shared National Credit Process


I. Introduction to Regulatory Risk Ratings and the Shared National Credit (SNC) Program


A. Overview of Credit Risk in Banking

Credit risk stands as the paramount financial risk pervading the banking system, inherently present in virtually all income-generating activities. Its effective and proactive management is not merely a best practice but a critical determinant of a bank's sustained performance. Historically, the depletion of capital reserves due to loan losses has been a leading cause of institutional failures, underscoring the foundational importance of robust credit risk oversight.1 The ubiquitous nature of credit risk across a bank's operations necessitates a sophisticated, dynamic, and deeply integrated risk rating framework. Such a framework is indispensable for maintaining financial stability and ensuring the safety and soundness of banking institutions.

B. Purpose and Importance of Regulatory Risk Ratings

Regulatory risk ratings serve as an essential mechanism for identifying, quantifying, and differentiating credit risk across individual credits and portfolios. This systematic measurement enables both bank management and external supervisory bodies to continuously monitor changes and emerging trends in risk levels.1 By providing a standardized and objective measure of credit quality, these ratings facilitate informed decision-making, allowing institutions to strategically manage risk to optimize returns while adhering to prudential standards. These ratings function as a common language and a critical diagnostic tool, fostering shared understanding and enabling effective communication regarding credit exposures between internal bank functions and external supervisory authorities.

C. Introduction to the Shared National Credit (SNC) Program


1. Objectives and Scope

The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program is an interagency initiative specifically designed to assess risk within the largest and most intricate credit facilities. These facilities are characterized by being shared among multiple regulated financial institutions (banks) and nonbank investors.1 The program's core objectives include establishing uniformity in credit rating determinations and assessment methodologies, enhancing efficiency in risk analysis through the collection of bank-reported data, and ensuring the timely dissemination of results to both reporting institutions and regulatory agencies.1 The program's scope encompasses credits with a minimum aggregate loan commitment of $100 million or more, provided they are shared by three or more unaffiliated federally supervised institutions.1 This program represents a direct and strategic response to the systemic risk potential inherent in large, widely syndicated credits, aiming to standardize risk assessment across a diverse participant base and thereby mitigate the potential for inconsistent regulatory treatment or supervisory gaps.

2. Historical Context and Evolution

The SNC Program was established in 1977, initially focusing on borrowers with aggregate loan commitments of $20 million or more shared by at least two regulated financial institutions.1 A significant modification occurred in 1998, increasing the minimum number of regulated institutions required for an SNC designation to three.1 Further adaptation to market dynamics led to another crucial adjustment effective January 1, 2018, when the minimum aggregate loan commitment threshold was raised from $20 million to $100 million. This increase was specifically implemented to account for inflation and the evolving average size of syndicated loans.1 The progressive evolution of SNC thresholds and participant requirements demonstrates regulators' adaptive capacity, continuously refining their oversight mechanisms to remain relevant and effective in addressing the increasing scale and complexity of syndicated lending activities.

3. Interagency Agreement

The governance of the SNC Program is formalized through an interagency agreement involving three principal federal banking regulatory bodies: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).1 This collaborative framework, uniting key supervisory agencies, establishes a unified regulatory front. This concerted approach is crucial for minimizing jurisdictional inconsistencies and fostering a comprehensive, holistic view of systemic credit risk across the entire U.S. banking system. Such large, complex credits, if not consistently monitored and assessed, could pose significant systemic threats.

II. Foundational Concepts of Credit Risk Rating Systems


A. Functions and Expectations of Bank Credit Risk Rating Systems

Well-managed credit risk rating systems are instrumental in promoting bank safety and soundness by facilitating informed decision-making across various banking functions. These systems are designed to accurately measure and differentiate individual credits and groups of credits based on the risk they present, enabling continuous monitoring of risk levels and trends.1
Beyond mere compliance, these systems are integral to several critical operational and strategic functions:
●	Credit Approval and Underwriting: Risk ratings directly influence the authorization levels for credit approvals, the permissible exposure limits, and the structural elements of credit facilities, including collateral requirements and repayment terms.1
●	Loan Pricing: They serve as a fundamental guide for setting loan prices, ensuring that the compensation for assuming credit risk is commensurate with the potential impact on earnings and capital, thereby preventing imbalances between risk and return.1
●	Relationship Management and Credit Administration: The assigned risk rating dictates the intensity and frequency of relationship administration, with higher-risk credits necessitating more frequent reviews, analyses, and direct borrower engagement.1
●	Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and Capital Adequacy: Credit risk ratings form the bedrock for determining the ALLL, as each credit's inherent loss potential is factored into its rating. They also inform the assessment of appropriate capital levels required to absorb extraordinary, unexpected credit losses.1
●	Portfolio Management Information Systems (MIS) and Board Reporting: Risk rating reports, which aggregate and stratify risk data and highlight trends within the portfolio, are vital for effective credit risk management and strategic decision-making at both management and board levels.1
●	Traditional and Advanced Portfolio Management: These ratings significantly influence a bank's strategic decisions regarding the acquisition, sale, retention, and hedging of credit facilities within its portfolio.1
An effective credit risk rating system transcends the role of a mere compliance tool; it operates as a strategic asset that seamlessly integrates risk management across the entire lending lifecycle, from the initial origination and underwriting phases through ongoing administration and portfolio optimization.

B. Key Attributes of Effective Internal Rating Systems

The OCC expects national banks to maintain credit risk management systems that produce accurate and timely risk ratings, considering precise credit classification a top supervisory priority.1 An effective internal risk rating system must possess several key attributes:
●	Integration: The system should be fully integrated into the bank's overarching portfolio risk management framework, serving as the foundational element for credit risk measurement, monitoring, and reporting, and providing essential support for board-level decision-making.1
●	Board Oversight: The bank's board of directors is responsible for approving the credit risk rating system, clearly assigning responsibility and accountability for the rating process, and receiving sufficient information to effectively oversee its implementation by management.1
●	Comprehensive Coverage: All credit exposures, without exception, should be rated. For small-denomination performing loans where individual ratings may not be practical, banks should assign a composite credit risk rating to the portfolio that adequately defines its risk profile.1
●	Granularity: The system must incorporate an adequate number of rating grades, particularly within the "pass" category, to ensure sufficient differentiation of risks among healthy credits.1
●	Accuracy and Timeliness: Risk ratings must be consistently accurate and promptly updated to reflect current conditions.1
●	Clear Definitions: The criteria for assigning each rating must be clear and precisely defined, incorporating both objective factors (e.g., cash flow coverage, debt-to-worth ratios) and subjective considerations (e.g., quality of management, willingness to repay).1
●	Holistic Risk Reflection: Ratings should capture the risks stemming from both the borrower's expected performance and the structural characteristics of the transaction itself.1
●	Dynamism: The risk rating system must be dynamic, ensuring that ratings are updated whenever there is a change in the underlying risk profile.1
●	Independent Validation: The risk rating process should undergo independent validation, in addition to regulatory examinations. This involves back-testing to verify that the assumptions embedded in the rating definitions are valid and accurately predict outcomes.1
●	Documentation: Every assigned rating must be thoroughly supported and documented within the credit file.1
The emphasis on dynamic, independently validated, and meticulously documented ratings highlights a regulatory expectation for proactive and evidence-based risk management. This approach moves beyond static, compliance-driven assessments toward a continuous, data-informed evaluation of credit quality.

C. Developments in Bank Risk Rating Systems

The banking industry has witnessed significant advancements in internal risk rating processes, driven by a desire for increased precision and effectiveness in credit risk measurement and management.

1. Pass Risk Ratings and Dual Rating Systems

One of the most notable changes has been the expansion in the number of rating categories, particularly within the "pass" category. This increased granularity allows for a more precise measurement of default and loss probabilities, which in turn facilitates more accurate loan pricing, improves the allocation of ALLL and capital, and enhances early warning capabilities for portfolio management.1
Furthermore, some banks have adopted dual rating systems. These typically involve assigning one rating to the general creditworthiness of the obligor and another, separate rating to each specific credit facility. The facility rating incorporates the loss protection provided by collateral and other structural elements, in addition to the obligor's inherent creditworthiness.1 The OCC does not mandate a specific rating system (single or dual) but expects all systems to comprehensively address both the obligor's capacity and willingness to repay, as well as the support derived from the transaction's structure and collateral.1 The trend toward more granular pass ratings and dual rating systems reflects a growing sophistication in risk differentiation, empowering banks to optimize capital allocation and pricing strategies more effectively.

2. Linking Internal and External (Public) Ratings

Banks are increasingly integrating external, public credit ratings from nationally recognized agencies such as Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's Rating Agency, and Fitch into their internal risk management frameworks.1 This practice is driven by several factors, including the use of public ratings to develop internal credit models, to fill gaps in proprietary default and loss data, and to enhance portfolio liquidity by obtaining ratings for loans and loan pools.1 While these external ratings offer a valuable benchmark and data source, regulatory guidance emphasizes the primacy of a bank's independent, dynamic internal assessment. Examiners' risk ratings must be grounded in their own analysis of the specific facts and circumstances affecting a credit's risk, and internal ratings are expected to change when risk changes, irrespective of whether a public rating has been updated.1 This approach prevents over-reliance on potentially less sensitive external views and ensures that internal risk assessments remain responsive to evolving credit conditions.

3. Role of Automated Scoring Systems

The adoption of commercial credit risk models and automated scoring systems has gained traction, particularly in larger banks. These systems are utilized to confirm internal ratings, assign finer distinctions within broad categories, and supplement judgmentally assigned ratings.1 Models typically fall into two categories: statistical systems, which rely on quantitative factors indicative of default, and expert systems, which aim to replicate a credit analyst's decision-making process.1
However, the development and full embrace of these models face challenges, primarily due to the historical scarcity of comprehensive commercial loan data, particularly for defaults and losses, making it difficult to construct robust statistical databases.1 Furthermore, these models have not yet undergone extensive testing across a full business cycle, raising questions about their accuracy during periods of economic downturn when safety and soundness concerns are most acute.1 Consequently, automated scoring systems should be rigorously evaluated, periodically validated, and used as a supplement to more traditional credit risk management tools, such as in-depth credit analysis and individual loan review, until more comprehensive experience is gained across diverse market conditions.1 The cautious integration of automated scoring systems reflects a regulatory balance between leveraging technological efficiencies and acknowledging the inherent limitations of models, particularly their untested performance across complete economic cycles.

III. Regulatory Risk Rating Classifications: Definitions and Standards


A. Overview of Regulatory Classifications

Regulatory agencies employ a common, standardized risk rating scale to identify and categorize problem credits. This scale comprises four distinct classifications: Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Credits that do not fall into any of these categories are designated as "pass" credits, for which no formal regulatory definition exists.1 The use of a unified regulatory classification system ensures consistent supervisory assessment across all institutions. This standardization is critical for enabling comparative analysis of asset quality across the banking sector and for facilitating the early identification of potential systemic vulnerabilities that might otherwise be obscured by disparate internal rating methodologies.

B. Detailed Definitions of Regulatory Ratings


1. Pass

A "Pass" credit facility is characterized by being in good standing, without any designation as special mention or any form of adverse classification.1 These represent the highest quality loans, exhibiting the lowest probability of default. Borrowers associated with pass credits demonstrate adequate capacity to meet their financial commitments, and the full and timely repayment of both principal and interest is expected.1 While specific quantitative benchmarks for "Pass" are not explicitly detailed in regulatory definitions, they are inferred from the characteristics that lead to adverse classifications. Pass credits typically exhibit strong and stable cash flow, low leverage, robust liquidity, sound management, and operate within favorable industry conditions. The absence of a formal regulatory definition for "Pass" highlights that the primary regulatory focus is on identifying and mitigating weaknesses. This approach implicitly trusts banks to effectively manage their healthy credit portfolios but simultaneously requires granular internal differentiation within this category for effective internal portfolio management, pricing, and capital allocation.

2. Special Mention (SM)

A Special Mention (SM) asset possesses potential weaknesses that warrant close attention from management. If these potential weaknesses are not corrected, they may lead to a deterioration in the repayment prospects for the asset or negatively impact the institution's credit position at a future date. SM assets are not considered adversely classified and do not yet expose the institution to sufficient risk to justify an adverse classification.1
Characteristics: SM assets indicate an elevated level of risk, but default is not considered imminent. Borrowers might be experiencing adverse operating trends, such as declining revenues or compressing margins, or exhibit an ill-proportioned balance sheet (e.g., an increase in inventory without a corresponding rise in sales, high leverage that is not yet jeopardizing repayment, or tight but not critical liquidity). External factors like adverse economic or market conditions, such as rising interest rates or the entry of new competitors, can also contribute to an SM rating. Nonfinancial factors, including management problems, pending litigation, an ineffective loan agreement, or other material structural weaknesses, as well as any significant deviation from prudent lending practices, may also support an SM designation.1
Quantitative/Qualitative Standards:
●	Quantitative: Indicators may include declining revenues or margins, increasing inventory without sales growth, high leverage (e.g., Total Debt/EBITDA approaching or exceeding 4.0x-5.0x for typical corporates), and tight liquidity. For instance, United Publication Company, Inc. (Example A) exhibited high leverage (Senior 6.5X, Total 7.5X EBITDA), negative tangible net worth, and deficit working capital, with a projected Fixed Charge Coverage (FCC) of 1.0X, suggesting minimal margin for debt reduction despite stable earnings.1
●	Qualitative: The presence of potential weaknesses, identified management issues, an ineffective loan agreement, or deviations from sound lending practices are key qualitative drivers.
The Special Mention classification serves as a crucial early warning indicator, compelling banks to proactively address nascent credit weaknesses before they escalate into more severe classified assets and potential losses.

3. Substandard (SS)

A Substandard (SS) asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by any collateral pledged. Such assets must exhibit a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by a distinct possibility that the bank will incur some loss if the identified deficiencies are not corrected.1
Characteristics: Substandard assets typically carry a high probability of payment default or possess other clearly defined weaknesses. They demand more intensive supervision from bank management. Common characteristics include current or expected unprofitable operations, inadequate debt service coverage, insufficient liquidity, or marginal capitalization. Repayment for these assets may increasingly depend on the realization of collateral value or other credit risk mitigants.1
Quantitative/Qualitative Standards:
●	Quantitative: Indicators include current or expected unprofitable operations, inadequate debt service coverage (e.g., FCC significantly below 1.0X, or minimal margin), inadequate liquidity, marginal capitalization, and high leverage (e.g., Total Debt/EBITDA exceeding 6.0x-7.0x). Consolidated Equipment Company, Inc. (Example B) had high leverage, minimal tangible net worth, breakeven EBITDA, and insufficient capacity for interest payments, with sales declining due to industry slowdown.1 Many Promotional Items, Inc. (Example C) showed a FCC of only 0.43X and funded debt/EBITDA at 10X, reflecting excessive operating losses and inadequate cash flow.1
●	Qualitative: The presence of well-defined weaknesses, the necessity for intensive supervision, and a reliance on collateral or mitigants for repayment are key qualitative factors.
The "distinct possibility of loss" associated with Substandard assets signifies a critical transition from potential to probable impairment, necessitating immediate and focused remedial action from the bank to mitigate further deterioration.

4. Doubtful (D)

A Doubtful (D) asset exhibits all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard classification, with the additional characteristic that these weaknesses render collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.1
Characteristics: A doubtful asset indicates a high probability of total or substantial loss, but its classification as an outright loss is deferred due to specific, identifiable pending events that possess a realistic, albeit uncertain, potential to strengthen the asset. Such pending events could include mergers, acquisitions, liquidations, capital injections, the perfection of liens on additional collateral, the valuation of collateral, or refinancing efforts. Borrowers with doubtful assets are typically in default, lack adequate liquidity or capital, and often do not possess the necessary resources to continue as a viable operating entity.1
Quantitative/Qualitative Standards:
●	Quantitative: Common indicators include an inability to meet contractual debt service requirements, questionable liquidity sources, large and sustained operating losses, breakeven or negative EBITDA, and insufficient capacity to make interest payments. Consolidated Equipment Company, Inc. (Example B) illustrates these characteristics, with large operating losses, significant decline in equipment orders, and current cash flow projections unable to meet debt service, with questionable liquidity.1
●	Qualitative: The collection in full is highly questionable and improbable, and the asset's fate is heavily reliant on uncertain pending events, often in the context of a severely distressed condition or unfavorable industry outlook.
The "Doubtful" classification represents a critical juncture where loss is highly probable, but a definitive write-off is postponed due to a realistic, albeit uncertain, prospect of recovery contingent upon specific future events.

5. Loss (L)

Assets classified as Loss are considered uncollectible and possess such minimal value that their continued recognition as bankable assets is unwarranted. This classification does not imply the complete absence of any recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is impractical or undesirable to defer writing off an asset that is fundamentally worthless.1
Characteristics: The underlying borrowers of loss assets are often in bankruptcy, have formally suspended debt repayments, or have otherwise ceased normal business operations. There is little to no prospect of collecting either the principal or interest on these obligations.1
Quantitative/Qualitative Standards:
●	Quantitative: Financial indicators typically include an illiquid and nearly insolvent position, profits and cash flows that are demonstrably insufficient to amortize debt over any reasonable timeframe, and a lack of improvement in interim financial results. Many Promotional Items, Inc. (Example C) had significant deterioration, severe leverage, negative tangible net worth, excessive operating losses, and inadequate cash flow, with a funded debt/EBITDA ratio of 10X and revenues trailing projections by 20%.1
●	Qualitative: The asset is deemed uncollectible, possesses negligible value, and its write-off is mandated due to the impracticality of deferring recognition. The underlying obligor's operational cessation or bankruptcy status is a common qualitative factor.
The "Loss" classification mandates immediate charge-off, signifying a definitive recognition of unrecoverable value and preventing the misleading overstatement of bank assets on the balance sheet.
Table 1: Regulatory Risk Rating Definitions

Rating Designation	Key Definition	Primary Characteristics	Implications for Bank
Pass	In good standing, not Special Mention or Classified. Highest quality loans with lowest probability of default. 1	Adequate capacity to meet financial commitments; full and timely repayment expected. 1 Strong, stable cash flow; low leverage; robust liquidity; sound management; favorable industry conditions.	Implicitly trusted for bank management; requires granular internal differentiation for portfolio optimization.
Special Mention (SM)	Potential weaknesses deserving management's close attention; if uncorrected, may deteriorate repayment prospects or credit position. Not adversely classified. 1	Elevated risk, but default not imminent. Adverse operating trends (declining revenues/margins), ill-proportioned balance sheet (e.g., high leverage, tight liquidity), management problems, structural weaknesses. 1	Crucial early warning indicator; prompts proactive management intervention to prevent escalation to classified status.
Substandard (SS)	Inadequately protected by obligor's worth or collateral; well-defined weaknesses jeopardize debt liquidation; distinct possibility of loss if deficiencies not corrected. 1	High probability of payment default. Current/expected unprofitable operations, inadequate debt service coverage, inadequate liquidity, marginal capitalization. Repayment may depend on collateral. 1	Signals probable impairment; demands immediate and focused remedial action to mitigate potential losses.
Doubtful (D)	All weaknesses of Substandard, plus collection/liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable based on current facts/values. 1	High probability of total/substantial loss, but classification deferred due to specific pending events (e.g., mergers, capital injections, refinancing). Borrowers usually in default, lack adequate liquidity/capital. 1	Critical juncture where loss is highly probable; postponement contingent on realistic, but uncertain, recovery prospects from specific future events.
Loss (L)	Considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as bankable asset is unwarranted; impractical/undesirable to defer write-off. 1	Borrowers often in bankruptcy, suspended debt repayments, or ceased operations. Little prospect of collecting principal or interest. 1	Mandates immediate charge-off; definitive recognition of unrecoverable value; prevents misleading overstatement of bank assets.

C. Split Ratings: Substandard/Doubtful/Loss, Pass/Adverse Rating, Partial Charge-off

In situations where a single credit exposure presents varying degrees of risk across its components, more than one rating may be assigned. This typically occurs when collateral or other structural protection supports only a portion of the credit.1 This approach provides a nuanced and granular assessment of credit risk, accurately reflecting the heterogeneous nature of repayment sources and collateral protection within a single credit facility.
The three common types of split ratings are:
●	Substandard/Doubtful/Loss: This classification is applied to collateral-dependent loans where the value of the collateral is uncertain and falls within a range. The portion of the loan that is supported by the lower, more conservative collateral valuation is rated Substandard. The segment supported by a higher, less certain value is classified as Doubtful. Any portion of the loan that falls outside this range of values is classified as Loss.1
●	Pass/Adverse Rating: This split rating is utilized when a distinct portion of a credit has an unquestionable repayment source, such as being fully secured by cash, other liquid collateral (e.g., listed securities, commodities, livestock, provided the bank maintains reasonable controls to mitigate out-of-trust sale risk), or an unconditional "payment" guarantee from a financially responsible and liquid third party. The remaining portion of the credit, however, exhibits potential or well-defined credit weaknesses and receives an adverse rating.1
●	Partial Charge-off: This designation is assigned when the recorded balance of a loan, after a partial charge-off, is being reliably serviced, meaning payment sources are stable and performance is sustained, and the remaining balance is reasonably expected to be collected in full. The residual balance of the loan may then receive a "Pass" rating, or a "Special Mention" or other adverse rating if potential or well-defined weaknesses persist.1

D. Accrual Status and Nonaccrual Determination

Accrual status is a critical accounting reflection of a credit's risk profile, directly impacting a bank's reported earnings and asset quality. It serves as a key trigger for heightened regulatory scrutiny.
A loan that is on nonaccrual status, or is about to be placed on nonaccrual, indicates severe underlying problems where the full collection of both interest and principal is highly questionable. Such nonaccrual loans will almost invariably be classified.1
General Rule for Nonaccrual: Banks are generally prohibited from accruing interest, amortizing deferred net loan fees or costs, or accreting discounts on any asset if:
●	The asset is maintained on a cash basis due to a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition.
●	Payment in full of principal or interest is not expected.
●	Principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more, unless the asset is both well secured and actively in the process of collection.1
Exceptions: Specific exceptions to this general rule apply to certain purchased credit-impaired loans (under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) criteria) and consumer loans or loans secured by one-to-four-family residential properties, although these still remain subject to other alternative evaluation methods.1
Return to Accrual Status: A nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status only when none of its principal and interest is due and unpaid, and the bank reasonably expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest. Alternatively, it may return to accrual if it becomes well secured and is actively in the process of collection.1
Capitalization of Interest: The capitalization of interest (adding accrued interest to the principal balance) for reporting purposes is permitted only when the borrower is creditworthy and possesses the demonstrable ability to repay the debt in the normal course of business. This practice is generally inappropriate for most classified loans, including those designated as Loss, Doubtful, Value-Impaired, or Nonaccrual.1

IV. The Shared National Credit (SNC) Rating Process: A Step-by-Step Guide


A. SNC Program Mechanics and Review Cycle

The SNC Program conducts its reviews in the first and third quarters of each calendar year.1 Large agent banks are subject to two reviews annually, while other agent banks are reviewed less frequently.1 The findings from these reviews are consolidated into a single annual statement issued by the agencies, capturing a combined assessment from the preceding 12 months.1
The selection of SNC transactions for review employs a risk-based sampling methodology. In 2024, this approach specifically targeted bank-identified leveraged loans, special mention and classified loans, and credits extended to borrowers operating in stressed industry segments.1 This risk-based sampling and staggered review cycle reflect a targeted and efficient regulatory approach, prioritizing oversight of the most volatile and systemically important credit exposures within the syndicated loan market.

B. Data Reporting Requirements for SNCs


1. What to Report (Credit, Obligor, Sponsor, Agent, Participant Details)

Federally supervised institutions are mandated to report syndicated credits for which they serve as the agent or administrative agent, provided these credits meet the established SNC definition.1 Each distinct tranche or facility within a credit agreement that features different terms or participant groups must be reported as a separate credit.1 Institutions that have been specifically notified by their primary federal regulator are also required to provide detailed participant data, encompassing information on purchased syndications.1
The comprehensive data submission includes:
●	Obligor Details: The full legal name of the primary obligor, its headquarters location (city, state, country, ZIP/Postal Code), an Internal Entity ID and Previous Internal Entity ID, Short Name, Industry Code (NAICS preferred or SIC), Tax Identification Number (TIN), and Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).1
●	Sponsor Details (New as of September 2024): Information on financial sponsors holding at least 25% ownership of the obligor. This includes similar entity attributes as obligors, along with a "Does this Credit have Financial Sponsors?" indicator and the "Ownership Percentage".1
●	Agent Bank Details: The legal entity serving as the lead or primary agent and its location. If the agent holds a share of the Global Committed amount greater than zero, it must also be reported as a participant in the credit.1
●	Credit Details: An Internal Credit ID and Previous Internal Credit ID, CUSIP (optional), Origination Date, Maturity Date, Credit Agreement Date, a new required Credit Agreement Identifier (as of September 2024), Credit Type, Credit Purpose, Global Committed and Global Outstanding amounts, the responsible Department, a Leveraged Lending Flag, and general Comments.1
●	Leveraged Lending (LL) Ratios (New as of September 2024, optional until September 2025): Specific metrics include Total Outstanding Debt Repayment (Projected 7 Year), Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (TTM), LL Interest Coverage Ratio (TTM), Total Committed Leverage Ratio (TTM), Total Outstanding Leverage Ratio (TTM), and Cost Savings/Synergies Add Backs as a % of Adj EBITDA (TTM), along with their respective "as of" dates. Sample calculation methodologies are provided to promote consistency.1
●	Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Details (New as of September 2024): For credits identified as CRE, reporting includes whether the property is under acquisition/development/construction, if the obligor is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Property Type, Property Valuation, Valuation Type, Valuation as of Date, Loan to Value Ratio, Debt Yield Ratio (TTM), Debt Service Coverage Ratio (contractual amortization) TTM, and CRE Interest Coverage Ratio (TTM) with its "as of" date.1
●	Participants Details: For Agent submissions, each legal entity participating in the credit and its share of committed and outstanding amounts must be reported. For Participant submissions, the reporting institution or its consolidated subsidiary is reported as the sole participant.1
●	Ratings: Internal credit or obligor ratings must be converted into the seven-bucket Concordance Risk Rating Scale, along with the accrual status, nonaccrual date, and days past due.1
●	Basel Ratings: For institutions subject to Basel metrics, reporting includes Obligor Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), Effective Maturity (M), Loss Given Default (LGD) (both before and after credit risk mitigants), the effect of PD substitution and LGD adjustment approaches on Risk Weighted Assets (RWA), the effect of double default treatment on RWA, total RWA, Expected Credit Loss (ECL), and a Credit Risk Mitigants (CRM) Flag.1
The continuous expansion of SNC reporting requirements, particularly the introduction of detailed leveraged lending ratios and commercial real estate metrics, indicates regulators' increasing focus on granular, forward-looking risk indicators and specific high-risk segments. This evolution suggests a shift toward a more predictive supervisory model.

2. Who Must Report (Agent vs. Participant Bank Responsibilities)

The agent or administrative agent of the SNC is primarily responsible for submitting the required SNC data.1 The scope of federally supervised institutions subject to these reporting requirements is broad, encompassing FDIC-insured banks (including their branches and subsidiaries), bank holding companies and financial holding companies (and their non-bank subsidiaries), federally and state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks, and U.S. Subsidiaries of Foreign Banking Organizations.1 Each individual U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank is responsible for reporting SNCs for which it acts as the agent.1 Furthermore, if a federally supervised institution assumes administrative agent duties from another reporting institution (acting as a successor agent), it is obligated to report all necessary data elements.1
Agent Bank Role: The agent bank reports the legal entity that serves as the lead or primary agent for the credit. If this agent holds any share of the Global Committed amount (i.e., greater than zero), it must also be reported as a participant in that credit.1
Participant Bank Role: For participant submissions, the reporting institution itself, or its consolidated subsidiary, is reported as the sole participant. It is crucial that, in a participant submission, the agent of the credit is not the reporting entity or one of its consolidated subsidiaries.1
The clear delineation of reporting responsibilities between agent and participant banks, coupled with the comprehensive inclusion of various foreign banking organizations and their subsidiaries, demonstrates the regulators' intent to cast a wide net over all entities involved in large syndicated credits. This ensures full transparency and a complete picture of risk distribution across the market.

3. How to Report (SNC Reporting Application, Data Elements)

SNC data is submitted through the Agencies' secure, web-based SNC Reporting application.1 Authorized staff members are required to create a Login.gov profile to gain access to their institution's data within the system.1 The application offers flexibility, allowing data entry manually, via XML file upload, or through a combination of both methods.1 An option to copy credits reported in the previous quarter into the current reporting period is also available.1
Each institution's SNC Reporter Profile within the application specifies whether it is required to provide participant data, the type of internal rating system it employs, and if it is mandated to report applicable Basel III metrics.1 Starting September 30, 2024, institutions are required to provide a reconciliation for any credits from the prior reporting period that are not included in the current period, specifying reasons such as being paid off, charged off, cancelled, restructured, or no longer meeting SNC qualifications.1 The application incorporates built-in validation mechanisms that require the correction of errors before submission.1 The shift to a centralized, web-based reporting application with integrated validation and reconciliation features signifies a deliberate move toward greater data integrity and efficiency in regulatory oversight, ultimately reducing manual errors and enhancing the quality of trend analysis.

4. When to Report (Submission Schedule)

SNC data submissions adhere to a strict quarterly schedule. Data as of March 31st is due by April 30th; June 30th data by July 31st; September 30th data by October 31st; and December 31st data by January 31st.1 Should a due date fall on a weekend or federal holiday, the submission deadline is extended to the next business day.1 This rigorous quarterly reporting schedule ensures a timely and consistent flow of critical data, enabling regulators to maintain a near real-time pulse on the health and evolving risk profile of the largest syndicated credit exposures.

5. Data Retention and Confidentiality

All source data utilized in the preparation of SNC reports must be retained by the reporting institution for a period of five years from the date of submission.1 Reported data is classified as examination data and is treated with strict confidentiality by the Agencies. Data specific to individual reporting entities will not be published or publicly disclosed, and any aggregated data that is released will be anonymized to prevent the identification of any individual reporting entity.1 SNC data is accessible to credentialed examiners from the Agencies. Furthermore, examination results are shared with federally supervised participants in any SNC and, upon request, with the applicable state banking departments.1 These stringent data retention and confidentiality protocols balance the imperative for comprehensive regulatory oversight with the essential protection of proprietary bank information, thereby fostering trust while ensuring accountability.

C. The Credit Risk Evaluation Process within SNC


1. Financial Statement Analysis (Cash Flow, Liquidity, Leverage)

The credit risk evaluation process within the SNC framework commences with a rigorous analysis of the borrower's financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, sources and uses of funds statement, and financial projections.1 This quantitative analysis meticulously examines revenues, profit margins, income, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and capitalization to identify trends and anomalies that may impact borrower performance.1 The deep dive into cash flow, liquidity, and leverage, particularly for leveraged loans, reflects a regulatory understanding that these metrics are the most immediate and critical indicators of a borrower's ability to service debt and withstand financial stress, especially in structures where traditional collateral may be limited.
●	Cash Flow: The borrower's ability to generate a satisfactory level of cash flows is the primary source of repayment in all leveraged transactions.1 The analysis must adequately support the borrower's debt repayment capacity based on both actual and projected cash flows, which must be well-documented and supported.1 Examiners scrutinize the uses of cash flow, ensuring that funds anticipated for debt amortization are not diverted to discretionary purposes such as dividends, distributions, or excessive capital expenditures.1 Shortfalls in cash flow or debt service coverage are often the most evident indicators of a problem credit.1
●	Liquidity: The balance sheet serves as an early warning indicator for credit problems, particularly regarding liquidity.1 Inadequate liquidity is a common characteristic of substandard and doubtful assets.1 Liquidity is assessed through ratio analysis and the evaluation of financial projections to determine the borrower's capacity to withstand economic slowdowns or unplanned events.1
●	Leverage: High debt levels inherently increase the risk of default.1 Leverage is measured by various ratios, including debt-to-assets, debt-to-equity, cash flow-to-total debt, total debt/EBITDA, and senior debt/EBITDA, with specific benchmarks often exceeding industry norms for leveraged transactions.1
Table 3: Key Leveraged Lending Ratios and Benchmarks

Ratio Name	Calculation Formula 1	General Benchmark/Interpretation
Total Outstanding Debt Repayment (Projected 7 Year)	7-year projected cumulative free cash flow / Total Outstanding Debt	Pass: High percentage (e.g., >80-90%), indicating strong future repayment capacity.
SM: Moderate percentage (e.g., 60-80%), with some reliance on future growth.
SS: Low percentage (e.g., <50%), indicating significant reliance on refinancing or asset sales.
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (TTM)	Adj EBITDA / Fixed Charges (TTM) (including contractual principal, cash interest, CAPEX, PIK, dividends, cash taxes) 1	Pass: Comfortably > 1.25x-1.50x.
SM: Approaching 1.0x-1.25x, with minimal buffer.
SS: < 1.0x, indicating inability to cover fixed charges from operations.
LL Interest Coverage Ratio (TTM)	TTM Adj EBITDA / Total Cash Interest (TTM) 1	Pass: Comfortably > 2.0x-3.0x.
SM: Approaching 1.5x-2.0x, with tightening interest coverage.
SS: < 1.0x-1.5x, indicating inability to cover interest from operations.
Total Committed Leverage Ratio (TTM)	Total Committed Debt / Adj EBITDA (TTM) 1	Pass: Well below 3.0x-4.0x (typical for investment grade).
SM: Approaching or exceeding 4.0x-5.0x (for typical corporates), but within amended covenant thresholds.
SS: > 6.0x-7.0x, indicating very high debt burden relative to earnings.
Total Outstanding Leverage Ratio (TTM)	Total Outstanding Debt / Adj EBITDA (TTM) 1	Pass: Well below 3.0x-4.0x.
SM: Approaching or exceeding 4.0x-5.0x.
SS: > 6.0x-7.0x.
Cost Savings/Synergies Add Backs as a % of Adj EBITDA (TTM)	EBITDA cost savings/synergies / Adj EBITDA (prior to pro forma adjustments) 1	Pass: Low to moderate, indicating sustainable organic performance.
SM/SS: High percentage, indicating reliance on unproven or aggressive projections for financial performance.

2. Qualitative Considerations (Management, Industry, Underwriting)

The credit risk evaluation process extends beyond quantitative financial analysis to incorporate crucial qualitative factors. The integration of these qualitative elements alongside numerical data acknowledges that financial numbers alone do not capture the full spectrum of credit risk, particularly the dynamic and human elements critical to a borrower's long-term viability.
●	Management: The competency and integrity of a business borrower's management team are paramount. Their ability to strategically guide the entity, capitalize on opportunities, develop and execute business plans, and adapt to market changes significantly impacts the company's financial well-being. The unexpected loss of key personnel or periods of rapid growth can pose significant challenges, often leading to business failure.1
●	Industry: A thorough industry analysis is essential to understand the operating environment of a business, including cyclical trends, competitive pressures, and technological advancements. Most industries experience some degree of cyclical volatility, and many are subject to seasonal variances, all of which directly influence a company's operating performance and financial condition.1
●	Underwriting: Underwriting is the process by which banks structure credit facilities to minimize risks and achieve optimal returns for the risks assumed. Sound underwriting practices incorporate protective measures such as coordinating repayment schedules with cash flow, establishing robust covenants, and securing adequate collateral. Weaknesses in underwriting or structural protections, often driven by competitive pressures, directly increase credit risk and can lead to a Special Mention rating or outright classification, even if the immediate impact on performance is not apparent.1

3. Credit Risk Mitigation (Collateral, Guarantees, Letters of Credit, Derivatives, Insurance)

Credit risk mitigants are structural enhancements designed to moderate credit risk, primarily by affecting the loss given default (LGD) rather than significantly reducing the probability of default (PD) itself.1 While these mitigants are crucial for reducing loss severity, regulators caution against overstating their impact on default probability, emphasizing that the primary focus should remain on the borrower's inherent repayment capacity.
●	Collateral: Collateral is the most prevalent form of credit risk mitigation. It involves assets pledged to the lender, granting the lender the right to take possession upon borrower default. The effectiveness of collateral in reducing losses is a function of its value, liquidity, and marketability. Collateral valuations must be realistic and consider "value under duress" (e.g., orderly or forced liquidation value), as a "going concern" valuation is rarely appropriate for troubled loans. The portion of a loan covered by conservatively valued collateral is typically classified as Substandard, with any remaining balance classified as Doubtful or Loss.1
●	Guarantees: Loans may be guaranteed by related or unrelated businesses or individuals. The guarantor's financial strength, including their capacity and willingness to honor the guarantee, is a major consideration. Guarantee agreements should be precise, detailing the specific credit facilities covered and the conditions under which the guarantor is liable. Unconditional (or "payment") guarantees can mitigate both default and loss risk. Government guarantees typically result in a pass rating, but "comfort letters" generally do not enhance a credit's rating due to their non-binding nature.1
●	Letters of Credit (L/C): An L/C is a form of guarantee issued by a financial institution. While L/Cs rarely protect against default risk unless explicitly structured for loan payments, an L/C from a high-quality issuer can effectively prevent both default and losses by substantially mitigating the borrower's credit risk. The risk rating of a credit backed by a high-quality L/C should generally be no worse than Substandard. Irrevocable L/Cs mitigate risk, whereas revocable ones do not.1
●	Credit Derivatives: These instruments are used for capital management, portfolio management, and mitigating risk in individual transactions. For risk rating purposes, only derivatives for individual transactions are relevant, primarily mitigating loss rather than default risk. The effectiveness of credit derivatives can be compromised by various factors, including basis risk (mismatch between reference asset and loan terms), timing mismatches, materiality clauses (bank retains first loss), contract basis risk (less rigorous default definition), and the protection seller's default risk.1
●	Credit Insurance: A newer form of mitigation for commercial loans, credit insurance can enhance a credit's risk rating, similar to an L/C, provided the underwriting is acceptable and the insurer demonstrates strong financial health. Examiners evaluate coverage-limiting specifications, such as deductibles and exclusions, and the insurer's financial strength and default risk.1

4. Stress Testing Projections

The mandate for multi-scenario stress testing, particularly for leveraged loans and enterprise value, reflects a regulatory imperative to assess credit resilience under adverse conditions, moving beyond optimistic base-case assumptions. Financial projections must be rigorously analyzed under multiple scenarios, including downside, break-even, and best-case scenarios, and periodically stress-tested.1 For leveraged loans, projections must be appropriately stress-tested for one or multiple downside scenarios. Contingency plans are expected to anticipate changing conditions in debt or equity markets, especially when exposures rely on refinancing or recapitalization.1 Enterprise values and their underlying assumptions, which are often highly volatile, must also be tested under a range of stress scenarios, including business conditions more adverse than the base case.1 This comprehensive stress testing ensures that banks understand the potential impact of unfavorable market shifts on their credit portfolios.

V. Roles and Requirements in the SNC Process


A. The Agent Bank's Perspective


1. Responsibilities in Origination, Underwriting, and Syndication

Agent banks play a pivotal role in the leveraged loan market, often operating under an "originate-to-distribute" model where they arrange, underwrite, and then market loan facilities to third-party investors. This model allows them to generate fee income while managing their overall exposure to the borrower.1 This dual role as originator and syndicator creates inherent conflicts of interest and exposes the agent bank to price risk, particularly if changes in investor appetite impair their ability to sell down positions as planned.1
To manage these complexities, agent banks are required to:
●	Clearly define leveraged lending within their loan policies, outlining its purpose and financial characteristics.1
●	Adopt formal written policies addressing risk objectives, loan approval requirements (ensuring sufficient senior-level oversight), underwriting standards, distribution practices, and credit risk management controls.1
●	Develop explicit procedures for defining and managing "distribution fails," which occur when the bank is unable to sell down its exposure within a reasonable period (typically 90 days).1
●	Clearly define their intended hold level for a loan before syndication efforts commence, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance (e.g., lower of cost or market (LOCOM) or fair value option).1
●	Implement robust management of syndication pipeline exposure and establish limits on the length of time transactions can be held in held-for-sale accounts.1
The necessity for robust internal controls and transparent policies is paramount to align incentives with sound credit practices and mitigate the risks arising from these inherent conflicts.

2. Data Submission and Reporting Obligations

The agent bank bears the primary responsibility for submitting SNC data for all credits they agent or administer.1 This comprehensive data reporting obligation serves as the backbone of the SNC program, providing regulators with the necessary transparency into the initial structuring and ongoing performance of large, complex credits. The agent bank is required to report detailed information across various categories, including:
●	Obligor and Sponsor Details: Comprehensive information on the primary obligor and, as of September 2024, financial sponsors owning at least 25% of the obligor.1
●	Agent Bank Information: Details about the agent bank itself, including its location.1
●	Credit Terms: Contractual terms of the loan, including origination and maturity dates, credit type and purpose, and global committed and outstanding amounts.1
●	Leveraged Lending (LL) Ratios: As of September 2024, specific LL ratios (optional until September 2025) to provide deeper insight into the financial health of leveraged borrowers.1
●	Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Details: For CRE credits, new detailed information on property characteristics and related financial metrics.1
●	Participant Data: Information on all entities participating in the credit, including their committed and outstanding shares.1
●	Ratings: Internal credit and/or obligor ratings, converted to the standardized Concordance Risk Rating Scale, along with accrual status and delinquency information.1
●	Basel Ratings: For applicable institutions, detailed Basel III metrics such as Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD).1
Furthermore, agent banks must provide a reconciliation of credits not included from the prior reporting period 1 and adhere to a strict quarterly submission schedule.1 All source data must be retained for five years.1

3. Managing Leveraged Lending Exposure

Leveraged loans constitute a significant portion of total SNC commitments, representing nearly half of the aggregate volume. Critically, these loans account for a disproportionately high percentage of special mention and classified exposures (79% of special mention and 84% of classified commitments in 2024).1 This concentration of risk in leveraged lending within SNC portfolios necessitates heightened vigilance and adaptive risk management by agent banks, as these exposures are particularly sensitive to macroeconomic shifts, such as rising interest rates.1 Many leveraged loans are characterized by weak structures, exhibiting layered risks that combine high leverage levels, aggressive repayment assumptions, and other underwriting deficiencies.1 Agent banks are expected to employ risk management practices that strictly adhere to regulatory safety and soundness standards and demonstrate adaptability to evolving economic conditions.1

B. The Participant Bank's Perspective


1. Due Diligence and Independent Evaluation of Participations

Banks that purchase participations and assignments in leveraged loan arrangements are required to conduct a thorough and independent evaluation of the transaction and its associated risks before committing any funds.1 This regulatory mandate challenges the assumption of relying solely on the agent's underwriting and mitigates the risk of "herd mentality" in syndicated markets. Participant banks must apply the same standards of prudence, credit assessment and approval criteria, and "in-house" limits that they would employ if they were originating the loan themselves.1 Their internal policies should explicitly require obtaining and independently analyzing full credit information, including copies of all executed loan documents, legal opinions, and other relevant materials, directly from the lead lender.1

2. Data Submission and Reporting Obligations

Participant banks are required to provide SNC data if they are notified by their primary federal regulator.1 In participant submissions, the reporting institution or its consolidated subsidiary is designated as the sole participant.1 Participant bank reporting complements the data provided by agent banks, offering regulators a holistic view of risk distribution and concentration across the entire syndicated market, irrespective of the origination role. Participant banks report specific data elements related to their participation, including their Internal Entity ID, Legal Name, Share of Committed, and Share of Outstanding, as well as relevant credit details (excluding global committed/outstanding amounts and the credit agreement identifier, which are agent bank responsibilities).1

3. Monitoring Borrower Performance

Participant banks are expected to maintain policies that mandate careful monitoring of the borrower's performance throughout the entire life of the loan.1 This continuous monitoring reinforces their independent risk management capabilities, ensuring that they remain informed of evolving credit quality and can react promptly to any deterioration, rather than relying solely on updates from the agent bank.

C. The First Line of Defense (1LoD) at the Bank


1. Responsibilities in Credit Origination, Underwriting, and Monitoring

The First Line of Defense (1LoD) comprises the business units and personnel directly involved in credit origination, underwriting, and ongoing monitoring. Loan officers and credit originators are responsible for the initial credit analysis, structuring, and ensuring adherence to the bank's loan policies and underwriting standards. This includes defining appropriate loan structures, amortization requirements, collateral terms, covenants, and the permissible use of enterprise values.1 Their direct interaction with borrowers positions them as the primary risk owners and initial detectors of credit deterioration, emphasizing their critical role in proactive risk identification and management. Loan officers, due to their close contact with borrowers, possess the most timely information, making them key to early problem identification.1 In terms of monitoring, the 1LoD is responsible for reviewing and updating risk ratings whenever new relevant information is received, and for conducting formal credit reviews at least annually.1

2. Initial Risk Rating Assignment and Documentation

The 1LoD is responsible for assigning initial risk ratings based on the borrower's expected performance, financial strength, and the transaction's structure.1 They must ensure that these ratings are thoroughly supported by analysis and meticulously documented in the credit file.1 The quality of the 1LoD's initial risk rating and supporting documentation directly impacts the integrity of the bank's entire risk management system, forming the foundational input for all subsequent oversight and regulatory assessments. Any inaccuracies or deficiencies at this initial stage can propagate throughout the entire risk management framework.

D. The Second Line of Defense (2LoD) at the Bank


1. Role in Risk Management Oversight and Policy Setting

The Second Line of Defense (2LoD) functions as the architect and guardian of the bank's risk framework, providing independent oversight to ensure policies are robust, consistently applied, and aligned with the bank's risk appetite and regulatory expectations. This includes ensuring that a suitable framework is in place for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling credit risk.1 The 2LoD is instrumental in developing and approving board-approved policies and procedures that govern the risk rating process.1 They also establish clear responsibilities for various departments and personnel involved in the risk rating process and work to instill a credit culture that demands timely recognition of risk and exhibits low tolerance for rating inaccuracy.1 Furthermore, the 2LoD evaluates the adequacy of leveraged lending policies and underwriting guidance, ensuring they remain appropriate for the bank's operations.1

2. Independent Credit Review and Validation

Independent credit review functions within the 2LoD provide a critical check-and-balance, challenging the 1LoD's assessments to prevent optimism bias and ensure the integrity and objectivity of risk ratings. This function involves independent third-party verification of loan ratings to ensure accuracy and consistency, thereby augmenting overall oversight.1 The scope and formality of these verifications are tailored to the complexity and inherent risk of the bank's portfolio.1 The credit review team must be adequately staffed with sufficient numbers and expertise, and empowered to independently validate and communicate the effectiveness of the risk rating system to the board and senior management.1 For smaller banks lacking a dedicated department, staff not directly involved in the approval or management of rated credits can perform this review.1 For leveraged credits, these reviews evaluate risk rating integrity, valuation methodologies, and the quality of risk management at least annually, or more frequently if warranted by portfolio characteristics.1

3. Internal Audit's Role in Process Integrity

Internal Audit provides an overarching assurance function, verifying the operational effectiveness of all risk management controls and data flows, thereby reinforcing trust in the bank's reported risk profile. Their responsibilities typically include testing the integrity of risk rating data and reviewing associated documentation.1 They also test internal processes and controls related to perfecting, valuing, and managing collateral.1 A crucial aspect of their role is verifying that other control functions, such as credit review, are operating as intended, and validating risk rating data inputs into the management information systems.1

VI. Regulatory Rating Determination and Outcomes


A. Point-in-Time Rating Determination

Examiners assess credit risk based on the borrower's expected performance over the foreseeable future, which is typically defined as a period of at least 12 months. The primary focus is on the borrower's anticipated ability to service its obligations in accordance with the loan terms.1 While the borrower's historical payment performance is always incorporated into the credit analysis, risk ratings are fundamentally designed to measure
future risk rather than merely record past events.1 This forward-looking nature of regulatory ratings emphasizes proactive risk identification and challenges banks to anticipate future deterioration rather than merely reacting to past defaults.
The primary consideration in credit risk assessment is the strength of the primary repayment source, defined as a sustainable source of cash under the borrower's control, explicitly or implicitly reserved for debt obligations.1 As the primary repayment source weakens and the probability of default increases, collateral and other protective structural elements gain greater significance in determining the rating.1 In some instances, loans may be so poorly structured (e.g., with deferred interest payments or no meaningful amortization) that they warrant classification even if the immediate likelihood of default appears low.1

B. Quantitative and Qualitative Standards for Each Rating Designation

Regulatory risk ratings are determined by a comprehensive assessment that integrates both quantitative and qualitative factors.
General Assessment Factors include:
●	The borrower's current and expected financial condition, encompassing cash flow, liquidity, leverage, and free assets.1
●	The borrower's capacity to withstand adverse conditions, typically assessed through stress testing.1
●	The borrower's history of servicing debt, the correlation between projected and historical repayment capacity, and the borrower's willingness to repay.1
●	Underwriting elements embedded in the loan agreement, such as loan covenants, amortization schedules, and reporting requirements.1
●	The quality and quantity of pledged collateral, its liquidity, the bank's control over it, and the impact of other credit risk mitigants.1
●	Qualitative factors, including the caliber of the borrower's management team, the strength and outlook of its industry, and prevailing economic conditions.1

1. Revenue, EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Leverage Trends for Each Rating (with examples)

The detailed financial characteristics and examples provided for each adverse rating category offer credit analysts a practical framework for translating complex financial realities into actionable regulatory classifications, ensuring consistency in risk assessment.
●	Pass:
○	Revenue Trend: Consistent growth or stability, aligned with market trends and often exceeding projections.
○	EBITDA Trend: Strong and stable, providing ample coverage for debt service and fixed charges, with healthy margins.
○	Free Cash Flow (FCF) Trend: Sufficient, predictable, and consistently covers all debt obligations, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, and potential dividends without reliance on external financing or asset sales.
○	Leverage Trend: Low to moderate (e.g., Total Debt/EBITDA comfortably below 3.0x-4.0x for typical corporates), with significant headroom against financial covenants.
○	Sample Description: A well-established manufacturing company with consistent revenue growth, strong EBITDA margins, and predictable free cash flow that comfortably covers all debt service, maintenance capex, and regular dividends. Leverage ratios are conservative and consistently below industry averages.
●	Special Mention (SM):
○	Revenue Trend: Flat or declining, potentially falling below initial projections, indicating nascent market or competitive pressures.
○	EBITDA Trend: Margins may be compressing, but EBITDA remains positive and generally sufficient to cover interest payments.
○	FCF Trend: Tightening, with reduced margin for error; may show reliance on minimal amortization or short-term liquidity injections.
○	Leverage Trend: Increasing (e.g., Total Debt/EBITDA approaching or exceeding 4.0x-5.0x for typical corporates), but still within amended or waived covenant thresholds. The balance sheet might show ill-proportioned assets, such as increasing inventory without corresponding sales growth.
○	Example (Inferred from United Publication Company, Inc. 1):
This company, while ultimately rated Substandard, exhibited characteristics that could precede that classification. Its financial synopsis noted high leverage (Senior Debt/EBITDA 6.5X, Total Debt/EBITDA 7.5X), negative tangible net worth, and deficit working capital. Although earnings were stable, growth plans were not realized. Cash flow provided for interest but only nominal debt reduction, highlighting a tightening FCF trend.
○	Sample Description: A retail chain experiencing a slight decline in same-store sales and compressing margins due to increased competition. While current cash flow still covers debt service, projections show minimal buffer, and the company's inventory levels are rising faster than sales. Management is implementing a turnaround plan, but its success is not yet proven.
●	Substandard (SS):
○	Revenue Trend: Significant and sustained decline, well below projections, indicating severe market, operational, or strategic issues.
○	EBITDA Trend: Breakeven or negative, demonstrably insufficient to cover interest payments.
○	FCF Trend: Inadequate, unable to cover liquidity needs, ongoing capital expenditures, debt repayment, and interest costs from operations.
○	Leverage Trend: Very high (e.g., Total Debt/EBITDA > 6.0x-7.0x), often accompanied by repeated covenant violations that necessitate waivers or restructures.
○	Example (Consolidated Equipment Company, Inc. 1):
This company's financial synopsis highlighted high leverage and minimal tangible net worth. Earnings and performance were poor, with expected merger synergies not materializing and sales declining. The last two fiscal years showed breakeven EBITDA and insufficient capacity for interest payments. Current cash flow projections were unable to meet contractual debt service requirements, with questionable liquidity sources.
○	Sample Description: A regional construction firm facing significant project delays and cost overruns, leading to sustained operating losses and negative EBITDA. Liquidity is severely strained, and the firm has violated several financial covenants, requiring a waiver from the bank. Repayment is now heavily reliant on the successful liquidation of a specific asset, but its value under duress is uncertain.
●	Doubtful (D):
○	Revenue Trend: Sustained, severe decline, often reflecting a fundamental failure of the business model or extreme contraction in its market.
○	EBITDA Trend: Consistently negative, indicating an inability to cover any fixed costs from operations.
○	FCF Trend: Severely negative, requiring continuous external capital injections or significant asset sales merely to sustain operations.
○	Leverage Trend: Extremely high, often indicative of technical insolvency or near-insolvency, with debt far exceeding any realistic asset value.
○	Example (Consolidated Equipment Company, Inc. 1):
A portion of this company's loan was classified as Doubtful. The risk rating considerations noted that the secondary support from enterprise value was suspect due to the company's severely distressed condition, immediate liquidity concerns, insufficient cash flow, and poor industry conditions.
○	Sample Description: A technology startup that has exhausted its initial funding, failed to achieve projected user growth, and is burning cash rapidly. It is in default on its loan, has minimal remaining liquidity, and its only hope for repayment lies in an uncommitted, highly speculative capital injection from a new investor, which is still in negotiation.
●	Loss (L):
○	Revenue Trend: Minimal or non-existent, reflecting a cessation of normal business operations.
○	EBITDA Trend: Deeply negative, indicating a complete lack of operational viability.
○	FCF Trend: No capacity to generate cash from operations; repayment is entirely dependent on asset liquidation.
○	Leverage Trend: Overwhelming, with debt far exceeding any remaining asset value or recovery potential.
○	Example (Many Promotional Items, Inc. 1):
A portion of this company's loan was classified as Loss. Its financial synopsis showed significant deterioration, severe leverage, negative tangible net worth, excessive operating losses, and inadequate cash flow. Revenues eroded by 10%, and funded debt/EBITDA was 10X. The loss classification was applied to tranches not supported by past or near-term financial performance or available secondary sources.
○	Sample Description: A small business whose primary asset was destroyed in a fire, with insufficient insurance coverage. The business has ceased operations, declared bankruptcy, and its remaining assets are minimal, with no prospect of collecting principal or interest.

Overwhelming, far exceeding any asset value.	A small business whose primary asset was destroyed in a fire, with insufficient insurance coverage. The business has ceased operations, declared bankruptcy, and its remaining assets are minimal, with no prospect of collecting principal or interest.

C. Easy Scoring System for Credit Analysts (Conceptual Framework)

To provide a structured yet flexible approach for credit analysts to consistently apply regulatory rating guidelines, a hybrid scoring system is essential. Such a system blends quantitative rigor with qualitative judgment, capturing the full complexity of credit risk, especially in leveraged transactions where "soft" factors and structural nuances play a significant role beyond raw numbers.
Components of the Scoring System:
1.	Quantitative Scorecard: This component involves assigning points based on key financial ratios, such as Debt/EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR), Free Cash Flow/Debt Service, and various Liquidity Ratios. These ratios are benchmarked against predefined thresholds, which may include industry norms, internal policy limits, and stress-tested thresholds.
2.	Qualitative Overlay: This involves applying adjustments based on subjective factors that are critical to a borrower's long-term viability. These factors include the quality of management, the outlook for the industry, the company's competitive position, the strength of underwriting, the quality of collateral, and the level of sponsor support. This component typically involves a narrative assessment followed by a qualitative score adjustment (e.g., a +/- 1 notch adjustment to the preliminary quantitative score).
3.	Structural Weakness Assessment: A systematic checklist or scoring mechanism is incorporated to identify and assess the impact of structural weaknesses. This includes factors such as an indefinite repayment program, weak or frequently waived covenants, inadequate collateral documentation, and undue reliance on refinancing as a primary repayment source.1
4.	Mitigant Impact Assessment: This step systematically evaluates the true reduction in Loss Given Default (LGD) provided by credit risk mitigants such as collateral, guarantees, Letters of Credit, and credit derivatives. It is crucial to ensure that the impact of these mitigants is not overstated in terms of reducing the probability of default.1
5.	Concordance Mapping: Once an internal score or grade is derived from the preceding steps, it is mapped to the SNC Concordance Risk Rating Scale based on predefined thresholds and the bank's internal policy.1
Process Flow:
●	Financial statements and relevant data are input, and quantitative scores are calculated.
●	Qualitative factors and structural weaknesses are assessed, leading to qualitative adjustments.
●	The impact of credit mitigants is considered, and the LGD and provisional rating are adjusted if applicable.
●	A provisional internal rating is derived.
●	This internal rating is then mapped to the standardized Concordance Risk Rating Scale.
●	The entire rationale for the final rating is thoroughly documented.

Table 2: SNC Concordance Risk Rating Scale


Concordance Rating Name	Description 1	General Internal Rating Equivalent
Investment Grade (IG) Pass	Highest quality loans with lowest probability of default. Borrowers have adequate capacity to meet financial commitments; full and timely repayment expected.	Highest quality internal ratings; typically corresponds to external ratings of BBB- or higher.
Non-Investment Grade (Non-IG) Pass	Internal rating buckets that fall between Investment Grade and Lowest Rated Pass.	Internal ratings below Investment Grade but not yet considered Lowest Rated Pass.
Lowest Rated Pass (LRP)	Internal rating bucket(s) one or more notches above the Special Mention equivalent. (At least one notch for <10 pass buckets; at least two for >=10 pass buckets).	Internal ratings immediately preceding the Special Mention category, indicating heightened but still acceptable risk.
Special Mention (SM)	Potential weaknesses deserving management's close attention. If uncorrected, may deteriorate repayment prospects or credit position. Not adversely classified.	Internal ratings identifying nascent credit deterioration, requiring proactive monitoring.
Substandard (SS)	Inadequately protected by obligor's worth or collateral; well-defined weaknesses jeopardize debt liquidation; distinct possibility of loss.	Internal ratings indicating probable impairment and requiring intensive supervision.
Doubtful (D)	All weaknesses of Substandard, plus collection/liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable.	Internal ratings where loss is highly probable, but specific pending events offer a slim chance of recovery.
Loss (L)	Considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as bankable asset is unwarranted.	Internal ratings indicating unrecoverable value, mandating immediate charge-off.

D. Problem Loan Management and Remedial Actions

Once adverse ratings are assigned, proactive problem loan management becomes crucial for mitigating potential losses and preserving bank capital, transforming a reactive approach to credit deterioration into a structured recovery process. Banks are expected to formulate individual action plans with clear, quantifiable objectives and defined timeframes for all adversely rated and other high-risk borrowers whose operating performance deviates significantly from planned targets.1 These action plans may involve working collaboratively with the borrower towards an orderly resolution, selling the loan in the secondary market, or initiating liquidation procedures.1 Problem credits must be subject to regular and frequent reviews to ensure the accuracy of their risk ratings, appropriate accrual status, timely recognition of impairment through specific allocations, and necessary charge-offs.1

E. Accounting Implications of Risk Ratings (ALLL, Nonaccrual, Restructured Loans)

Risk ratings directly dictate critical accounting treatments, linking supervisory assessments to a bank's financial statements and ensuring that reported earnings and capital accurately reflect underlying credit quality.
●	Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL): Banks with held-for-investment leveraged loans must ensure that the inherent risks are fully incorporated into their ALLL and capital adequacy analyses. Leveraged exposures should be accounted for either through a detailed analysis of estimated credit losses from the discrete portfolio or as part of an overall portfolio analysis utilizing the institution's internal risk grades. Exposures heavily reliant on enterprise value, due to their inherent volatility and difficulty in full support, require special evaluation to determine the necessity and adequacy of specific allocations within the ALLL.1
●	Nonaccrual Status: As previously detailed, loans with severe problems, where the full collection of interest and principal is highly questionable, are placed on nonaccrual status. These loans are almost always classified, directly impacting the bank's reported interest income and thus its earnings.1
●	Formally Restructured Loans: Formally restructured loans must be clearly identified by the bank's internal credit review system and closely monitored by management. When analyzing such loans, the focus is on the borrower's ability to repay in accordance with the modified terms. A restructured credit may warrant a Special Mention status if potential weaknesses persist, or an adverse classification if well-defined weaknesses are evident. To be upgraded to a "Pass" rating, restructured loans generally require a period of sustained performance, typically six months, under the new terms.1

VII. Appeal Process and Risk Management Benchmarks


A. Overview of the SNC Appeal Process

The multi-tiered SNC appeal process provides a critical safeguard for banks, ensuring fairness and due process in supervisory decisions, while also offering regulators a feedback loop on the clarity and consistency of their own assessments.
General Appeals Process: The process encourages early, informal resolution of concerns. An informal appeal can be submitted in writing to the bank's local supervisory office within 10 days of receiving a final written agency decision. If dissatisfied, the bank may file a formal appeal with the Deputy Comptroller for the local supervisory office or directly with the Ombudsman within 60 days of receiving the final written agency decision. This formal appeal must be signed by the bank's President or Chief Executive Officer and include board approval of the action.2
SNC Specific Appeals:
●	Agent Bank: An agent bank may file an appeal with the Deputy Comptroller within 14 calendar days of notification by the Examiner-in-Charge regarding the preliminary disposition of the credit.2
●	Participant Bank: A participant bank has the option to appeal either through the agent bank or independently to the Deputy Comptroller within 14 calendar days of receiving the preliminary SNC results from the agent bank. If the agent bank does not provide preliminary results, the participant bank may file an appeal within 14 days of receiving the official SNC results directly from its primary regulator.2
●	Second-tier Appeals: For SNC matters, a second-tier appeal to the Ombudsman may be filed within 30 days of receiving the Deputy Comptroller's decision.2
It is important to note that, as a general rule, decisions under dispute are not stayed during the pursuit of an appeal.3

B. General Scoring Benchmarks for Risk Management Discussions with Regulators

Regulatory discussions on risk management benchmarks extend beyond purely quantitative ratios, encompassing the holistic quality of a bank's risk governance framework, with a particular emphasis on the effective identification and management of high-risk segments like leveraged lending and concentrated industries.
Key benchmarks and areas of focus for discussions with regulators include:
●	Overall Risk Management Quality: Assessed as weak, acceptable, or strong, based on the effectiveness of the bank's policies, processes, personnel, and control systems.1
●	Policy Adequacy: Evaluation of formal written policies for leveraged lending, including clear definitions, risk objectives, loan approval requirements, pricing strategies, action plans for deteriorating credits, robust underwriting standards, established concentration limits, and safeguards against conflicts of interest.1
●	Process Effectiveness: Assessment of how policies are communicated, the timeliness and utility of Management Information Systems (MIS), the accuracy and integrity of data, the effectiveness of compliance monitoring, the rigor of the underwriting process, the accuracy of risk ratings, adherence to laws and accounting guidelines, the monitoring of enterprise valuations, the administration of problem credits, the integrity of loan documentation, and the management of risk limits.1
●	Personnel Competency: Evaluation of the adequacy of expertise and staffing levels, and whether performance management and compensation programs are appropriately aligned with risk objectives.1
●	Control System Adequacy: Assessment of the effectiveness and independence of critical control functions, including loan review 1, internal and external audit 1, and MIS.1
●	Risk Rating Accuracy: A key benchmark for internal risk rating accuracy is that typically less than 5% of credits reviewed, or 3% of the dollar amount, should exhibit inaccuracies that understate risk.1
●	ALLL Adequacy: Ensuring that all risks, particularly those from leveraged loans, are fully and appropriately incorporated into the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and capital adequacy analyses.1
●	Leveraged Lending Exposure: Regulators closely monitor the disproportionate risk within leveraged lending. In 2024, agent bank-identified leveraged loans constituted 45% of total SNC commitments but accounted for a significantly higher proportion of special mention (79%) and classified (84%) commitments. This imbalance is a critical benchmark for risk discussions.1
●	Industry Concentrations: High special mention and classified rates in specific industry segments are closely scrutinized. For instance, in 2024, Technology, Telecom, and Media (19.7%), Commercial Services (17.4%), Health Care and Pharmaceuticals (14.4%), Materials and Commodities (12.4%), and certain Commercial Real Estate sub-sectors (e.g., Office) showed elevated risk levels.1
●	Non-Pass Holdings: The distribution of non-pass holdings across different lender types is also a benchmark. Nonbank entities held a disproportionate share of non-pass leveraged commitments (59.6% of special mention and classified in 2024), while banks' share of non-pass exposure increased from 35.0% to 40.4% in 2024.1
