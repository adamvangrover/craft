# Substandard Accrual Rating Profile

## I. Definition

A "Substandard" asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by any collateral pledged. Such assets must exhibit a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by a distinct possibility that the bank will incur some loss if the identified deficiencies are not corrected.

A Substandard loan is on **accrual status** when it is reasonably certain that the borrower will be able to make all contractually due interest payments, even if the principal is at risk. The "well-defined weakness" is significant, but the bank still expects to collect all interest due.

## II. Key Characteristics and Criteria

- **Primary Repayment Source:** The primary source of repayment is insufficient to service the debt, and the borrower is relying on secondary sources, such as asset sales or refinancing.
- **Financial Performance:** The borrower is experiencing significant operating losses, negative cash flow, or a rapid deterioration in financial condition.
- **Leverage:** Leverage is high and may be increasing, and the borrower may be in violation of financial covenants.
- **Liquidity:** Liquidity is strained, and the borrower may be unable to meet its near-term obligations without external support.
- **Management:** There may be significant concerns about management's ability to address the company's problems.
- **Industry and Market Position:** The borrower may be in a declining industry or have a weak competitive position.
- **Collateral:** The bank may be reliant on collateral for repayment, but there may be uncertainty about its value or liquidity.

## III. Quantitative and Qualitative Indicators

### Quantitative
- **Leverage:** Total Debt/EBITDA > 6.0x
- **Coverage:** Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio < 1.0x
- **Profitability:** Sustained operating losses.
- **Liquidity:** Negative working capital or a reliance on asset sales to fund operations.

### Qualitative
- **Management:** A lack of a credible turnaround plan.
- **Industry:** A secular decline in the industry.
- **Competitive Position:** A loss of key customers or a significant decline in market share.
- **Financial Policy:** An unsustainable capital structure.

## IV. Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: Energy Company
An oil and gas exploration and production company is facing a prolonged period of low commodity prices. The company is unprofitable and has high leverage. It is in violation of its financial covenants and is seeking a waiver from its lenders. The company is still making its interest payments, but it is reliant on asset sales to fund its operations and reduce its debt.

### Example 2: Healthcare Company
A rural hospital is facing declining patient volumes and reimbursement rates. The hospital is unprofitable and has a high debt burden. It is reliant on a government subsidy to continue operating. The hospital is current on its interest payments, but its long-term viability is in question.

## V. Common Triggers for Upgrade or Downgrade

- **Upgrade:** A significant improvement in financial performance, a successful refinancing, or a sale of the company.
- **Downgrade to Substandard Non-Accrual:** A determination that the borrower is no longer able to make its interest payments. This typically occurs when a loan is 90 days or more past due. A downgrade to Doubtful would occur if collection in full is highly questionable and improbable.
