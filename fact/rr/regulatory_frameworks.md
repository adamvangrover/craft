# An Overview of Key Regulatory Frameworks

A sound understanding of the regulatory landscape is essential for any financial analyst. This section provides a high-level overview of the key regulatory frameworks that govern the financial industry.

## 1. Basel Accords

The Basel Accords are a series of three international banking regulations that set out the minimum capital requirements for financial institutions.

*   **Basel I:** Introduced in 1988, the first Basel Accord focused on credit risk and established a minimum capital requirement of 8% of risk-weighted assets.

*   **Basel II:** Published in 2004, Basel II refined the capital requirements by introducing a three-pillar framework:
    *   **Pillar 1:** Minimum capital requirements, which expanded the scope of risk to include operational risk and market risk.
    *   **Pillar 2:** Supervisory review, which requires banks to have internal processes to assess their capital adequacy and for supervisors to evaluate those assessments.
    *   **Pillar 3:** Market discipline, which aims to increase transparency by requiring banks to disclose more information about their risks and capital.

*   **Basel III:** Developed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, Basel III introduced more stringent capital requirements, as well as new liquidity and leverage ratios. The key components of Basel III include:
    *   **Higher Capital Ratios:** Increased the minimum capital requirements and introduced a new "capital conservation buffer."
    *   **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):** Requires banks to hold enough high-quality liquid assets to cover their total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period.
    *   **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):** Requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their off-balance-sheet exposures.

## 2. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

Enacted in the United States in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was a sweeping piece of legislation that brought significant changes to financial regulation. Key provisions of the act include:

*   **The Volcker Rule:** Prohibits banks from engaging in certain types of speculative investments, such as proprietary trading.
*   **The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC):** Created to identify and monitor systemic risks to the financial system.
*   **The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** A new agency with the authority to regulate consumer financial products and services.

## 3. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)

Passed in 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in response to a number of high-profile corporate accounting scandals. The act introduced new standards for corporate governance and accountability, including:

*   **Section 302:** Requires that the principal officers (typically the CEO and CFO) of the company certify the accuracy of their financial reports.
*   **Section 404:** Requires that management and the external auditor report on the adequacy of the company's internal control over financial reporting (ICFR).

## 4. Solvency II

Solvency II is a regulatory framework for insurance companies that was implemented in the European Union in 2016. It is similar in structure to the Basel Accords for banks and is based on a three-pillar framework:

*   **Pillar 1:** Quantitative requirements, including capital requirements and valuation of assets and liabilities.
*   **Pillar 2:** Governance and supervision, including requirements for risk management and internal controls.
*   **Pillar 3:** Reporting and disclosure, which requires insurance companies to disclose more information about their risks and capital.
