# Case Study: Technology Company - "Innovate Corp."

## I. Introduction

This case study examines the credit profile of Innovate Corp., a venture-backed technology company that has developed a new software platform for the logistics industry. The company has a $10 million venture debt facility with a specialized lender.

## II. Borrower and Industry Overview

- **Borrower:** Innovate Corp. is a pre-revenue company that has spent the last three years developing its software platform. The company has a high burn rate and is reliant on equity injections from its venture capital investors to fund its operations.
- **Industry:** The logistics technology industry is highly competitive, with a number of well-funded startups and established players.

## III. Financial Analysis

Innovate Corp. is pre-revenue and has no meaningful financial history. The company's financial projections are highly speculative and are based on a number of key assumptions that may not be realized.

## IV. Qualitative Factors

- **Management:** The management team is composed of experienced technology executives, but they have a limited track record in the logistics industry.
- **Product:** The company's software platform is innovative, but it is not yet clear if there is a significant market demand for it.
- **Venture Capital Support:** The company is backed by a reputable venture capital firm, which has invested $20 million in the company. However, the VC firm has indicated that it is not willing to provide any additional funding.

## V. Rating Determination

### Initial Assessment:

- The primary source of repayment (cash flow from operations) is non-existent.
- The company has a well-defined weakness (a high burn rate and no revenue) that jeopardizes the timely repayment of the loan.
- The company is entirely reliant on a secondary source of repayment (a sale of the company) to repay the loan.
- The company has missed its last interest payment and is in default.

### Rating Recommendation: Doubtful

The credit is assigned a "Doubtful" rating. The loan has all the characteristics of a Substandard credit, and collection in full is highly questionable and improbable. However, the classification is deferred to Doubtful because there is a pending event that could result in a full recovery for the lender. Innovate Corp. has received a letter of intent (LOI) from a large, strategic competitor to acquire the company for $30 million. The acquisition is subject to due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement. If the acquisition is completed, the lender will be repaid in full. If the acquisition falls through, the company will likely be forced to liquidate, and the lender will suffer a significant loss.

## VI. Action Plan

- The bank will closely monitor the progress of the acquisition negotiations.
- The bank will engage legal counsel to protect its interests in the event that the acquisition falls through.
- The bank will obtain a valuation of the company's intellectual property.
- The relationship manager will work closely with the workout group to manage the credit and maximize the bank's recovery.
