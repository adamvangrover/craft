# Case Study: Healthcare Company - "Rural Health Services"

## I. Introduction

This case study examines the credit profile of Rural Health Services (RHS), a non-profit organization that operates a small, critical access hospital in a rural community. RHS has a $20 million term loan with a regional bank, which was used to finance the construction of a new wing of the hospital.

## II. Borrower and Industry Overview

- **Borrower:** RHS is the only hospital within a 50-mile radius and is a major employer in the community. The hospital is highly reliant on Medicare and Medicaid for reimbursement.
- **Industry:** The rural healthcare industry is facing significant challenges, including declining populations, an aging patient base, and pressure on reimbursement rates. Many rural hospitals are unprofitable and have closed in recent years.

## III. Financial Analysis

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 (LTM) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $30M | $28M | $25M |
| EBITDA | $1.0M | -$0.5M | -$2.0M |
| EBITDA Margin | 3.3% | -1.8% | -8.0% |
| Total Debt/EBITDA | 20.0x | N/A | N/A |
| Cash on Hand (days) | 60 | 45 | 30 |

### Key Observations:

- **Revenue and EBITDA:** Revenue has been declining for several years, and the hospital is now generating significant operating losses.
- **Profitability:** The hospital's financial situation is dire. The EBITDA margin has fallen to -8.0%, and the hospital is burning through cash.
- **Leverage and Liquidity:** Leverage is extremely high, and the hospital's liquidity position is precarious. Cash on hand has fallen to just 30 days.

## IV. Qualitative Factors

- **Management:** The management team is dedicated and experienced, but they are struggling to cope with the challenging industry environment.
- **Community Support:** The hospital has strong support from the community, and there is a local foundation that provides some financial assistance.
- **Government Support:** The hospital receives a "critical access" designation from the federal government, which provides enhanced reimbursement rates. However, this is not enough to offset the other challenges.

## V. Rating Determination

### Initial Assessment:

- The primary source of repayment (cash flow from operations) is insufficient to service the debt.
- The hospital has a well-defined weakness (sustained operating losses) that jeopardizes the timely repayment of the loan.
- The hospital is reliant on secondary sources of repayment, such as asset sales or government grants, which are uncertain.
- Despite the severe financial distress, the hospital has continued to make its interest payments, and the loan is not yet 90 days past due.

### Rating Recommendation: Substandard Accrual

The credit is assigned a "Substandard Accrual" rating. The hospital's financial condition is dire, and there is a distinct possibility that the bank will sustain a loss. However, the loan is still on accrual status because the hospital has been able to make its interest payments, and there is a reasonable prospect that it will be able to continue to do so in the near term, likely through a combination of community and government support.

## VI. Action Plan

- The bank will meet with the hospital's management and board of directors to discuss the financial situation and the hospital's plans to address the operating losses.
- The bank will engage a third-party healthcare consultant to conduct a viability analysis of the hospital.
- The bank will obtain an appraisal of the hospital's real estate and equipment.
- The relationship manager will transfer the credit to the bank's workout group for intensive management.
