# Case Study: Manufacturing Company - "Steel Fabricators Inc."

## I. Introduction

This case study examines the credit profile of Steel Fabricators Inc. (SFI), a mid-sized manufacturing company that specializes in fabricating steel components for the construction industry. The company has a $50 million revolving credit facility with a regional bank. The facility is subject to annual review.

## II. Borrower and Industry Overview

- **Borrower:** SFI has been in business for over 20 years and has a solid reputation for quality and reliability. The company is privately owned by its founder, who is also the CEO.
- **Industry:** The construction industry is cyclical and highly correlated with the broader economy. In recent years, the industry has been strong, but there are signs of a slowdown.

## III. Financial Analysis

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 (LTM) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $150M | $175M | $160M |
| EBITDA | $20M | $25M | $18M |
| EBITDA Margin | 13.3% | 14.3% | 11.3% |
| Total Debt/EBITDA | 2.5x | 2.0x | 2.8x |
| Fixed Charge Coverage | 1.8x | 2.2x | 1.4x |

### Key Observations:

- **Revenue and EBITDA:** After a strong Year 2, revenue and EBITDA have declined in the last twelve months (LTM). Management attributes this to a slowdown in construction activity in their region.
- **Margins:** EBITDA margins have compressed significantly, from 14.3% to 11.3%. Management indicates that they have been unable to pass on rising steel costs to their customers.
- **Leverage and Coverage:** Leverage has increased to 2.8x, and the fixed charge coverage ratio has declined to 1.4x. While still acceptable, the trend is negative.

## IV. Qualitative Factors

- **Management:** The founder/CEO is experienced and well-respected. However, there is no clear succession plan, and the rest of the management team is relatively new.
- **Customer Concentration:** SFI has a high degree of customer concentration, with its top three customers accounting for over 50% of revenue.
- **Competition:** The steel fabrication industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry.

## V. Rating Determination

### Initial Assessment:

- The primary source of repayment (cash flow from operations) is still intact, but it is weakening.
- The company's financial performance has deteriorated, and the trend is negative.
- There are potential weaknesses in the company's management and customer concentration.

### Rating Recommendation: Special Mention

The credit is assigned a "Special Mention" rating. While the company is not yet in financial distress, there are potential weaknesses that warrant close attention from the bank. The negative trends in financial performance, the compression in margins, and the qualitative concerns about management and customer concentration all point to an elevated level of risk.

## VI. Action Plan

- The bank will meet with SFI's management to discuss the recent financial performance and the company's plans to address the identified weaknesses.
- The bank will increase its monitoring of the company, with a requirement for quarterly financial statements and covenant compliance certificates.
- The bank will conduct a field audit of the company's inventory and accounts receivable.
- The relationship manager will place the credit on their internal "watch list" and provide quarterly updates to senior management.
