# Special Mention Rating Profile

## I. Definition

A "Special Mention" (SM) asset possesses potential weaknesses that warrant close attention from management. If these potential weaknesses are not corrected, they may lead to a deterioration in the repayment prospects for the asset or negatively impact the institution's credit position at a future date. SM assets are not considered adversely classified and do not yet expose the institution to sufficient risk to justify an adverse classification.

## II. Key Characteristics and Criteria

- **Primary Repayment Source:** The primary source of repayment is still intact, but there are concerns about its long-term sustainability.
- **Financial Performance:** The borrower is experiencing adverse operating trends, such as declining revenues, compressing margins, or volatile cash flow.
- **Leverage:** Leverage may be increasing, or the balance sheet may be "ill-proportioned" (e.g., high inventory levels).
- **Liquidity:** Liquidity may be tightening, but is not yet at a critical level.
- **Management:** There may be concerns about management, such as turnover, a change in strategy, or a lack of depth.
- **Industry and Market Position:** The borrower may be facing adverse industry trends, increased competition, or a loss of market share.
- **Loan Structure:** There may be weaknesses in the loan structure, such as loose covenants or a lack of amortization.

## III. Quantitative and Qualitative Indicators

### Quantitative
- **Leverage:** Total Debt/EBITDA approaching 4.0x-5.0x
- **Coverage:** Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio approaching 1.0x-1.25x
- **Profitability:** Declining or volatile EBITDA margins.
- **Liquidity:** Tightening liquidity, with declining cash balances or increased reliance on a revolver.

### Qualitative
- **Management:** Recent management turnover or a new, unproven strategy.
- **Industry:** Increased competition or a cyclical downturn in the industry.
- **Competitive Position:** Loss of a major customer or a decline in market share.
- **Financial Policy:** A more aggressive financial policy, such as a large, debt-financed acquisition.

## IV. Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: Retail Company
A retail company is experiencing declining same-store sales and compressing margins due to increased competition from online retailers. While the company is still profitable, its cash flow is declining, and its leverage is increasing. Management has a turnaround plan, but its success is uncertain.

### Example 2: Manufacturing Company
A manufacturing company is facing a cyclical downturn in its industry. While the company has a strong balance sheet, its revenue and profitability are declining. The company has a large, fixed-cost base, which makes it vulnerable to a prolonged downturn.

## V. Common Triggers for Upgrade or Downgrade

- **Upgrade:** A sustained improvement in financial performance, a reduction in leverage, or the successful execution of a turnaround plan.
- **Downgrade:** A continued deterioration in financial performance, a further increase in leverage, or a failure to address the identified weaknesses. A downgrade to Substandard is likely if a well-defined weakness emerges that jeopardizes the timely repayment of the loan.
