# Agent Instructions for the Credit Analyst Development Hub

This document provides guidance for agents working on this project. The goal is to create a comprehensive and cohesive learning hub for credit analysts.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The content should be easy to understand for analysts at all levels. Avoid jargon where possible and explain complex concepts in simple terms.
*   **Practicality:** The content should be practical and applicable to the day-to-day work of a credit analyst. Use real-world examples and case studies where possible.
*   **Cohesion:** All the content should be linked together in a logical and intuitive way. The learning paths should be clear and easy to follow.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style and tone throughout the hub.

## Development Guidelines

*   **Markdown Files:** All the core content should be in markdown files. This makes it easy to edit and maintain.
*   **HTML Files:** The HTML files should be used to provide a clean and readable interface for the markdown content. Use simple, semantic HTML and a consistent stylesheet.
*   **Linking:** All content should be linked together. The `index.md` and `index.html` files in each subdirectory should serve as the main navigation hubs.
*   **Future Development:** When adding new content, consider how it fits into the existing structure. Create new markdown files for new topics and link to them from the relevant index files.
