# Advanced Financial Statement Analysis

## Module 7: Advanced Ratio Analysis

### 7.1 DuPont Analysis

DuPont analysis is a framework for dissecting a company's Return on Equity (ROE) into its three key components: profitability, asset efficiency, and financial leverage. This allows analysts to understand the drivers of ROE and to identify areas of strength and weakness.

*   **Formula:** ROE = (Net Profit Margin) x (Asset Turnover) x (Equity Multiplier)
*   **Net Profit Margin:** Net Income / Sales
*   **Asset Turnover:** Sales / Average Total Assets
*   **Equity Multiplier:** Average Total Assets / Average Shareholder's Equity

### 7.2 Beneish M-Score

The Beneish M-Score is a mathematical model that uses financial ratios to identify companies that may be manipulating their earnings. It is a useful tool for forensic accounting and for identifying potential red flags in a company's financial statements.

*   **The M-Score is calculated using eight financial ratios:**
    *   Days Sales in Receivables Index (DSRI)
    *   Gross Margin Index (GMI)
    *   Asset Quality Index (AQI)
    *   Sales Growth Index (SGI)
    *   Depreciation Index (DEPI)
    *   Sales, General, and Administrative Expenses Index (SGAI)
    *   Leverage Index (LVGI)
    *   Total Accruals to Total Assets (TATA)

A score greater than -1.78 indicates a high probability of earnings manipulation.

## Module 8: Forecasting Financial Statements

### 8.1 The Forecasting Process

Forecasting financial statements is a critical skill for financial analysts. It involves making assumptions about a company's future performance and then using those assumptions to project its income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.

*   **The forecasting process typically involves the following steps:**
    1.  Forecast revenue growth.
    2.  Forecast the income statement.
    3.  Forecast the balance sheet.
    4.  Forecast the statement of cash flows.
    5.  Use the forecast to value the company or to assess its credit risk.

### 8.2 Key Forecasting Drivers

The key to a good forecast is to identify the key drivers of a company's performance and to make reasonable assumptions about how those drivers will evolve over time.

*   **Common forecasting drivers include:**
    *   Revenue growth
    *   Profit margins
    *   Working capital requirements
    *   Capital expenditures
    *   Financing assumptions

By focusing on these key drivers, analysts can build a robust and defensible forecast that can be used to make informed investment and credit decisions.
