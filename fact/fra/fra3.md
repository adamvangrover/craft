# Case Study: Analyzing Apple Inc.'s Financials

This case study will walk you through a practical application of the concepts covered in this section, using Apple Inc. as our example. We will perform a comprehensive financial analysis, from spreading the financials to calculating key ratios and interpreting the results.

## 1. Finding and Spreading the Financials

As detailed in Module 4 of our beginner's guide, the first step is to obtain the company's 10-K report from the SEC's EDGAR database or the company's investor relations website.

Once you have the 10-K, the next step is to "spread" the financials into a standardized spreadsheet format. This allows for easier analysis and comparison. Here is a simplified spread of Apple's financials for the last three fiscal years (in millions USD):

| Line Item | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Income Statement** | | | |
| Net Sales | 383,285 | 394,328 | 365,817 |
| Cost of Sales | 214,137 | 223,546 | 212,981 |
| Gross Margin | 169,148 | 170,782 | 152,836 |
| R&D | 29,915 | 26,251 | 21,914 |
| SG&A | 24,932 | 25,094 | 21,973 |
| Operating Income | 114,301 | 119,437 | 108,949 |
| Net Income | 96,995 | 99,803 | 94,680 |
| **Balance Sheet** | | | |
| Current Assets | 143,566 | 135,405 | 134,836 |
| Total Assets | 352,583 | 352,755 | 351,002 |
| Current Liabilities | 145,308 | 153,982 | 125,481 |
| Total Liabilities | 290,437 | 302,083 | 287,912 |
| Total Equity | 62,146 | 50,672 | 63,090 |
| **Cash Flow Statement** | | | |
| Cash from Ops | 110,543 | 122,151 | 104,038 |
| Cash from Inv | 3,740 | (19,970) | (19,458) |
| Cash from Fin | (108,469) | (110,749) | (93,353) |

## 2. Calculating and Analyzing Key Ratios

Now, let's calculate and analyze some of the key financial ratios we discussed in Module 5.

| Ratio | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Profitability** | | | |
| Gross Margin % | 44.1% | 43.3% | 41.8% |
| Net Profit Margin % | 25.3% | 25.3% | 25.9% |
| **Liquidity** | | | |
| Current Ratio | 0.99 | 0.88 | 1.07 |
| **Leverage** | | | |
| Debt-to-Equity | 4.67 | 5.96 | 4.56 |

### Analysis

*   **Profitability:** Apple's gross margin has been steadily increasing, which is a positive sign of its pricing power and/or cost management. Its net profit margin has remained remarkably stable and high, demonstrating its consistent ability to turn revenue into profit.
*   **Liquidity:** The current ratio has fluctuated, dipping below 1.0 in 2022. For most companies, this would be a concern, but for a cash-generating machine like Apple, it's less of an issue and may reflect efficient cash management.
*   **Leverage:** The debt-to-equity ratio is high, which is not unusual for a company like Apple that uses debt to finance share buybacks and other shareholder-friendly activities.

## 3. Crafting the Narrative

Based on our analysis, we can craft a narrative about Apple's financial health:

"Apple continues to be a highly profitable company with strong brand power, as evidenced by its high and improving margins. While its top-line growth has slowed, its ability to generate cash remains exceptional. The company's high leverage is a result of its capital return program to shareholders and is not a cause for concern given its financial strength. The key challenge for Apple is to continue to innovate and find new avenues for growth."

This case study demonstrates how to apply the principles of financial analysis to a real-world company. By following these steps, you can develop a comprehensive understanding of a company's financial health and prospects.
