Bridging Principle and Practice: A Synthesis of Regulatory Guidance and Market Trends for the Fall 2025 Examination Cycle


Part I: The Regulatory Framework for Credit Risk Rating


Section 1.1: The Mandate and Function of a Credit Risk Rating System

The foundation of a safe and sound banking system rests upon the effective management of credit risk, which represents the primary financial risk inherent in virtually all of a bank's income-producing activities.1 The historical record is unambiguous: capital depletion resulting from loan losses has been the proximate cause of most bank failures. Consequently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) mandates that all national banks and federal savings associations maintain credit risk management systems capable of producing accurate and timely risk ratings. This is not a perfunctory compliance exercise; it is the essential first step in managing credit risk effectively and is considered a top supervisory priority.1
An institution's risk rating system must be tailored to the scale and complexity of its lending activities. While a large, multinational bank will require a sophisticated system with numerous rating grades, a community bank with a simpler portfolio may employ a less formal process. Regardless of the specific methodology, the core objective remains the same: to measure and differentiate credit risk, allowing management and examiners to monitor trends and manage risk to optimize returns.1
A well-conceived risk rating system functions as the central nervous system of a bank's credit risk management apparatus. Its outputs are not isolated data points but are integral inputs that drive a wide array of critical banking functions. An error or inaccuracy in a risk rating does not remain a localized issue; it propagates flawed signals throughout the organization, leading to a cascade of suboptimal decisions that can threaten the institution's stability. The key functions underpinned by the risk rating system include 1:
●	Credit Approval and Underwriting: Risk ratings are fundamental to establishing credit authority. They determine which officers or committees are authorized to approve a credit, the amount of credit that can be extended, and the essential structural components of the facility, such as collateral requirements, repayment terms, and the necessity of guarantor support.
●	Loan Pricing: A rating must directly inform the price of a loan. The premium charged for taking credit risk must be sufficient to compensate the bank for the potential risk to both earnings and capital. Inaccurate ratings lead to mispriced risk, which can result in lost business to competitors if priced too high, or, more dangerously, "adverse selection" if priced too low, attracting a disproportionate share of undesirable risks.
●	Relationship Management and Credit Administration: The assigned risk rating dictates the intensity of ongoing credit administration. Higher-risk credits demand more frequent and in-depth reviews, analysis, and borrower contact. Marginal and problem relationships necessitate intensive supervision by specialized workout teams to mitigate potential losses.
●	Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and Capital Adequacy: Risk ratings are the bedrock of the ALLL calculation. The inherent loss potential of every credit must be reflected in its rating, with an allowance provided either on an individual basis for impaired loans or on a pooled basis for performing loans. The ALLL must be directly and dynamically correlated with the level of risk indicated by the portfolio's ratings. Furthermore, these ratings are crucial for determining the appropriate amount of economic capital required to absorb unexpected credit losses.
●	Portfolio Management Information Systems (MIS) and Board Reporting: Aggregated risk rating data, stratified by various criteria and showing risk trends over time, is a critical component of MIS. These reports provide senior management and the board of directors with the necessary information for effective oversight and strategic decision-making.
●	Traditional and Advanced Portfolio Management: For institutions engaged in active portfolio management, risk ratings are a primary driver of decisions to buy, sell, hold, or hedge credit exposures.
The deep integration of the risk rating system across these functions underscores its paramount importance. A weakness in the rating process is not a mere administrative deficiency; it is a systemic flaw that undermines the integrity of the entire credit risk management framework, from individual loan decisions to the strategic direction of the institution.

Section 1.2: The Regulatory Rating Scale: Definitions and Application

To ensure consistency in supervisory assessments across the federal banking agencies, a common risk rating scale is used to identify and categorize problem credits. The regulatory definitions for Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss delineate increasing degrees of credit weakness. Credits that do not meet the criteria for any of these adverse ratings are considered "Pass" credits, for which no formal regulatory definition exists.1 Examiners are required to apply these definitions irrespective of the bank's internal rating system.
A nuanced understanding of the precise language within these definitions is critical, as the transition between categories represents a significant change in the nature and severity of the underlying risk.
●	Pass: A Pass-rated credit is not characterized by any potential or well-defined weaknesses that would warrant an adverse classification. It is the baseline expectation for a sound credit where repayment according to the contractual terms is expected.
●	Special Mention (SM): The official definition states: "A special mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution's credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification".1 The operative words are
potential and future. An SM rating is an early warning signal. The weakness is not yet jeopardizing the loan, but it has the potential to do so if not corrected. Examples include adverse operating trends, an ill-proportioned balance sheet, or material structural weaknesses in the loan agreement. Default is not considered imminent.1
●	Substandard: The official definition states: "A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected".1 The transition from SM to Substandard represents a fundamental phase shift in risk. The weakness is no longer a future potential; it is a
present and well-defined deficiency that is actively jeopardizing the collection of the debt. The language moves from conditional ("may result") to definitive ("is inadequately protected"). This classification marks the threshold for an "adversely classified" asset and signifies a high probability of payment default or the existence of other severe weaknesses requiring intensive management supervision.
●	Doubtful: The official definition states: "An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable".1 A Doubtful rating signifies that total or substantial loss is likely. However, the classification as a complete Loss is deferred because of specific, identifiable pending events that may improve the situation, such as a planned merger, capital injection, or collateral liquidation. These events should be resolvable within a relatively short period.
●	Loss: The official definition states: "Assets classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future".1 At this stage, the borrower may be in bankruptcy or have ceased operations, and there is little prospect of collecting principal or interest. The asset must be charged off in the period it becomes uncollectible.
The clear demarcation between "potential" and "well-defined" weakness is the conceptual lynchpin of the rating system. A migration of assets from the SM category to the Substandard category, as observed in recent market-wide data, is therefore not a simple incremental decline in quality. It is a highly significant indicator that previously identified potential risks have now materialized into tangible, present threats to the collectibility of debt, signaling a fundamental deterioration in the health of a credit portfolio.
Table 1: The Regulatory Risk Rating Scale

Rating	Official Definition (Abbreviated) 1	Key Differentiator
Pass	Not adversely classified.	Absence of defined weakness.
Special Mention	Has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these may result in deterioration at a future date.	Potential Weakness: A future-oriented risk that requires monitoring and correction to prevent deterioration.
Substandard	Is inadequately protected by the obligor's paying capacity or collateral. Has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt.	Well-Defined Weakness: A present, identifiable deficiency that is actively jeopardizing repayment.
Doubtful	Has all weaknesses of Substandard, but collection in full is highly questionable and improbable.	Improbable Collection: Loss is likely, but its final amount is deferred pending a specific, near-term event.
Loss	Considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.	Uncollectible: The asset is worthless for banking purposes and must be charged off.

Section 1.3: The Anatomy of Credit Evaluation

The assignment of a regulatory risk rating is the culmination of a thorough and forward-looking credit evaluation process. The central focus of this analysis is the borrower's expected performance and ability to repay its obligations in accordance with the loan terms.1 Past performance, while informative, is secondary to the assessment of future capacity. An analysis that is overly focused on historical performance fails its primary purpose, which is to measure risk rather than record history.1
The cornerstone of the evaluation is the assessment of the primary repayment source, which the OCC defines as a sustainable source of cash that is under the borrower's control and is available to service the debt obligation.1 The entire analytical process is designed to determine the strength and durability of this primary source over the foreseeable future, which is defined as a period of not less than one year.1 The core components of this evaluation are as follows:
●	Financial Statement Analysis: There is no substitute for a rigorous, detailed analysis of a borrower's financial statements. The balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows provide the essential quantitative data about a borrower's repayment capacity. This analysis must be sufficiently detailed to identify trends, anomalies, and changes in financial proportions (e.g., leverage, liquidity) that may signal a change in risk. The balance sheet, in particular, can provide early warnings of credit problems through asset degradation or shifts in the composition of assets and liabilities.1
●	Cash Flow Analysis: Business cash flow is the lifeblood of debt repayment. Examiners will conduct a detailed analysis of operating cash flow, scrutinizing the impact of changes in working capital accounts. It is critical to understand all uses of cash flow, as debt repayment is often not the only claim. A borrower that must cut necessary capital expenditures to generate cash for debt service may be solving a short-term problem while imperiling its long-term viability. A shortfall in cash flow or debt service coverage is often the most direct and obvious indicator of a problem credit.1
●	Analysis of Projections: While historical analysis establishes a track record, projections are necessary to estimate expected future performance. Examiner analysis will focus on the credibility of these projections. They must be assessed for reasonableness against historical performance, industry trends, and economic conditions. Projections should be stress-tested under multiple scenarios (e.g., downside, break-even). A borrower that repeatedly fails to meet its own projections demonstrates a lack of credibility, and an examiner's conclusion that projections are unachievable must be factored into the loan's risk rating.1
●	Qualitative Factors: The evaluation is not a purely quantitative exercise. Qualitative considerations are critically important and can often be determinative. These include 1:
○	Management: The competency, integrity, and depth of the borrower's management team are paramount. Their ability to execute a business plan, react to market changes, and navigate challenges is a crucial determinant of financial success.
○	Industry: An analysis of the borrower's industry is necessary to understand the competitive, cyclical, and technological forces at play. A strong company in a deteriorating industry faces significant headwinds that must be considered.
○	Economy: Broader economic conditions can impact even the strongest borrowers and must be incorporated into the forward-looking assessment of risk.
This comprehensive evaluation of repayment capacity forms the basis for the initial rating assessment. As the primary repayment source weakens and the probability of default increases, the focus of the analysis necessarily shifts to secondary sources of repayment, such as collateral and guarantees.1

Section 1.4: Identifying Structural Weaknesses and Assessing Risk Mitigants

Beyond the borrower's intrinsic financial capacity, the structure of the credit facility itself is a critical component of risk. Sound underwriting provides structural protections that can increase the likelihood of collection and allow the bank to control a deteriorating situation. Conversely, structural weaknesses create latent risks that can become acute when a borrower comes under stress.1
Structural Weaknesses as Latent Risk
Structural weaknesses are underwriting deficiencies that compromise a bank's ability to monitor and control a credit relationship. In a benign economic environment, a loan with weak covenants or an indefinite repayment program may continue to perform, masking the underlying vulnerability. However, these weaknesses are not benign; they are latent risks. When the borrower's primary repayment capacity falters due to economic or industry-specific stress, these structural flaws become active problems. They strip the bank of its early warning systems (e.g., covenant trips) and its contractual ability to intervene, leaving it with a problem credit and severely limited options. For this reason, examiners in a deteriorating credit environment will proactively identify and criticize these weaknesses, even in loans that are currently performing. The OCC has identified several prevalent structural weaknesses, including 1:
●	Indefinite or overly liberal repayment programs: This includes loans with no clear and reasonable source or timing of repayment, such as "evergreen loans" that continually revolve, effectively providing permanent debt capital to the borrower.
●	Nonexistent, weak, or waived covenants: Covenants are an essential control mechanism, providing the bank with an opportunity to take protective action if the borrower's financial condition deteriorates below prescribed standards. Waived or overly generous covenants are a significant structural flaw.
●	Inadequate debt service coverage: Loans underwritten with an insufficient cash flow margin to service principal and interest based on reasonable, documented performance assumptions.
●	Elevated leverage: Leverage ratios that are excessive for the industry or loan purpose.
●	Repayment highly dependent on projected events: This includes loans whose repayment is predicated on optimistic projections of cash flow, asset appreciation, or a future refinancing or recapitalization that is uncommitted and uncertain.
Examiners are explicitly instructed not to "defer or forgo criticism of fundamental underwriting flaws because they have become the 'competitive norm'".1
Assessing Credit Risk Mitigants
The presence of credit risk mitigants, such as collateral or guarantees, does not automatically justify a better risk rating. Their impact on the rating depends entirely on a realistic assessment of their effectiveness in reducing the ultimate loss the bank will incur. Except for certain types of guarantees, most mitigants do not lessen the probability of default; they primarily affect the loss given default. Therefore, their impact on a rating is generally negligible until a credit is already classified.1
●	Collateral: The assessment of collateral must focus on its realistic value, liquidity, and marketability. Valuations must consider the value under duress—that is, what the collateral will be worth in a forced or orderly liquidation scenario, not as part of a "going concern".1 The analysis must also account for all costs associated with repossession, holding, and selling the assets. When a loan's primary repayment source has failed and it becomes collateral-dependent, the portion of the loan fully covered by the net realizable value of conservatively valued collateral is typically classified
Substandard. Any portion of the loan not covered by this value should be classified Doubtful or Loss.1
●	Guarantees: A guarantee is only as strong as the guarantor's financial capacity and demonstrated willingness to perform. A presumption of willingness may be appropriate initially, but once financial support becomes necessary, willingness must be proven. A guarantee from an unwilling or litigious party that retards collection provides no beneficial effect on the risk rating.1 The structure of the guarantee is also critical. An unconditional "payment" guarantee, where the lender can demand payment from the guarantor without first exhausting legal remedies against the borrower, can mitigate default risk and may justify a more favorable rating. In contrast, a "collection" guarantee, which requires the lender to pursue the borrower first, provides less protection. So-called "comfort letters," which are not legally binding, generally provide no rating enhancement.1
A critical error in risk rating is to overstate the protection afforded by these mitigants. An account officer who assigns a less severe rating based on the mere existence of collateral, without a realistic assessment of its recoverable value, is misstating the true risk of the exposure.1

Section 1.5: The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program: A Framework for Supervisory Consistency

While the principles of credit evaluation and risk rating apply to all assets, a specialized framework is required to ensure consistency and uniformity in the supervision of the largest and most complex credit facilities—those shared by multiple financial institutions. This is the purpose of the Shared National Credit (SNC) Program, a long-standing interagency initiative designed to provide a consistent and efficient supervisory assessment of large, syndicated loans.1

The SNC Mandate and Scope
The SNC Program was established in 1977 by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Its primary objective is to provide an annual, coordinated review and rating of loan commitments that meet the SNC definition. A credit is considered an SNC if it is a loan or commitment of $100 million or more that is shared by three or more unaffiliated federally supervised institutions.1 This definition captures the significant syndicated loans that constitute a major portion of the credit risk in the U.S. banking system. The program ensures that every institution holding a piece of the same syndicated credit applies the same regulatory risk rating, preventing supervisory arbitrage and inconsistent risk management treatment.

The Review and Rating Process
The annual SNC review is a highly coordinated effort. Teams of examiners from the participating agencies conduct detailed credit analyses of the SNC portfolio. The process mirrors the fundamental credit evaluation described in Section 1.3, focusing on repayment capacity, financial analysis, and qualitative factors. However, the critical outcome of the SNC review is a single, binding regulatory rating for each facility. This agreed-upon rating (e.g., Special Mention, Substandard) is communicated to all participating banks and must be reflected in their internal risk management systems.1

This process provides several key benefits:
●	Consistency: It eliminates discrepancies where one bank might rate a credit as Pass while another, with the same exposure, rates it as Substandard. This uniform rating is crucial for the integrity of system-wide risk assessments.
●	Efficiency: By centralizing the in-depth review of these complex credits, the program avoids redundant and duplicative examination efforts at individual institutions.
●	Timeliness: The annual review provides a timely, market-wide snapshot of risk in the syndicated loan market, allowing for early identification of emerging trends and concentrations of risk.

Analysis and Industry Guidance
The SNC Program is not merely a rating exercise; it is a critical source of market intelligence. Following the annual review, the agencies aggregate the data and publish a public summary of the results. This report provides an invaluable analysis of credit trends, highlighting shifts in aggregate risk, concentrations of classified assets in specific industries, and structural weaknesses in underwriting. The findings and analysis in the SNC report, such as those detailed in Part II of this document, serve as direct supervisory guidance, informing examiners and bankers alike about the areas of greatest concern and shaping the focus of subsequent examination cycles.1

Part II: Analysis of the 2024 Shared National Credit Landscape


Section 2.1: Macro-Level Credit Trends: The Crystallization of Risk

The 2024 Shared National Credit (SNC) Program review, which assesses the largest and most complex loans shared by multiple financial institutions, paints a picture of a credit landscape under increasing strain. While the agencies characterize overall SNC credit risk as "moderate," they highlight a "modest increase in the severity of risk".1 This increased severity is not random; it is the direct consequence of persistent macroeconomic headwinds, namely the "continued pressure of higher interest rates" and the "impact of compressed operating margins in some industry sectors".1 These forces are testing borrower resilience and causing previously potential risks to become actualized losses.
The most telling indicator of this trend is not the modest overall increase in non-pass assets, but the significant internal migration of credits within the non-pass categories. This dynamic reveals a clear crystallization of risk, where potential problems are hardening into well-defined weaknesses. The key metrics from the 2024 review illustrate this shift starkly 1:
●	Total commitments rated Special Mention (SM) and Classified (Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss) rose by 4.1% to $595.8 billion.
●	This aggregate figure, however, masks a critical divergence. Commitments rated Special Mention—representing potential weaknesses—decreased by $14.8 billion, an 8.4% drop from 2023.
●	Simultaneously, commitments Classified—representing well-defined weaknesses—increased by $38.4 billion, a substantial 9.7% jump from 2023.
●	This migration is further confirmed by the most severe indicator: nonaccrual commitments surged by 29.1%, an increase of $14.7 billion, driven largely by deterioration in the Technology, Telecom, and Media sector.
This migration from SM to Classified is a profoundly negative signal. It indicates that the "potential weaknesses" identified in prior examination cycles are no longer being corrected or contained. Instead, under the pressure of higher debt service costs and squeezed profitability, they are deteriorating into the "well-defined weaknesses" that characterize Substandard credits, moving them significantly closer to default and loss.
Table 2: SNC 2024 Key Metrics: Year-over-Year Comparison

Metric	2023 Commitments ($ Billions)	2024 Commitments ($ Billions)	Change ($ Billions)	Change (%)
Total Commitments	$6,408.8	$6,521.9	+113.1	+1.8%
Special Mention Commitments	$176.6	$161.8	-14.8	-8.4%
Classified Commitments	$395.6	$434.0	+38.4	+9.7%
Nonaccrual Commitments	$50.4	$65.1	+14.7	+29.1%
Source: 2024 SNC Report, Exhibit 2 1					
The data in Table 2 provides the quantitative evidence for this thesis. The decline in the SM category is not a sign of improving credit quality; rather, it is the emptying of a holding pen as credits are downgraded into more severe classifications. The sharp increases in Classified and Nonaccrual commitments confirm that the economic environment is actively transforming risk into tangible problems for lenders.

Section 2.2: Leveraged Lending: A Locus of Systemic Concern

The 2024 SNC report leaves no doubt that leveraged lending is the epicenter of credit risk within the large-loan portfolio. The agencies state unequivocally that "credit risk associated with leveraged lending remains high".1 These loans, often used to finance mergers, acquisitions, and private equity buyouts, are characterized by high debt levels relative to a company's cash flow. Their risk profile is not just elevated; it is disproportionately so.
According to the report, agent bank-identified leveraged loans exhibit the following characteristics 1:
●	Dominant Share of Commitments: They comprise 45% of total SNC commitments, indicating their systemic importance.
●	Overwhelming Share of Risk: They account for a staggering 79% of all Special Mention commitments and 84% of all Classified commitments. This massive imbalance means that any discussion of problem credits in the SNC portfolio is, by definition, primarily a discussion about leveraged loans.
The concern extends beyond high leverage levels. The report repeatedly flags that "many leveraged loans contain weak structures" that feature "layered risks." These layered risks are a toxic combination of "high leverage levels, aggressive repayment assumptions, and other underwriting weaknesses".1 This points to a fundamental breakdown in underwriting discipline, where multiple risk factors are allowed to coexist within the same credit facility.
Perhaps the most critical warning in the entire report is the observation that "the performance of these leveraged loans has not been tested through a typical economic cycle".1 This statement, a fixture in past reports, has taken on a new and urgent meaning. The era of near-zero interest rates and abundant liquidity that fostered the growth of this asset class is definitively over. The current environment of sustained high interest rates and compressed corporate margins
is the test that has long been anticipated. The aggressive repayment assumptions underwritten in a more benign era are now being invalidated in real time by higher debt service costs that consume a greater share of a borrower's cash flow. The migration of credits from SM to Classified across the broader SNC portfolio can be seen as the first wave of results from this ongoing test, and the highly vulnerable leveraged loan segment is at its forefront.

Section 2.3: Sectoral Stress Analysis: The 2024 Focus Industries

The aggregate credit deterioration is not evenly distributed across the economy. The SNC review identifies five "Focus Industries" that are exhibiting high or increasing levels of stress, providing a heat map of where risk is most concentrated.1 These sectors are particularly vulnerable to the prevailing macroeconomic factors.
The 2024 Focus Industries and their non-pass (SM + Classified) rates are 1:
●	Technology, Telecom, and Media: This sector remains the most troubled, with the highest SM+Classified rate at 19.7%. It is a major driver of overall problem assets, accounting for a full one-third of all non-pass commitments in the SNC portfolio. This sector is particularly sensitive to higher interest rates, which impact valuations and the availability of venture capital and other funding sources necessary for growth-oriented, often non-profitable, business models.
●	Commercial Services: This broad category has seen its SM+Classified rate climb to 17.4%. These businesses are often susceptible to margin compression as they struggle to pass on rising labor and input costs to customers.
●	Health Care and Pharmaceuticals: This sector has a stable but high SM+Classified rate of 14.4%. While some segments are defensive, others, particularly those reliant on private equity sponsorship and high leverage, face pressure from rising costs and reimbursement uncertainties.
●	Materials and Commodities (excluding Oil & Gas): The SM+Classified rate here has risen to 12.4%, likely reflecting sensitivity to global growth, supply chain dynamics, and fluctuating input costs.
●	Commercial Real Estate (CRE): The overall non-pass rate for CRE is 8.2%, which is below the portfolio average. However, this aggregate figure masks a severe and deepening crisis in specific sub-sectors. The Office sub-sector, in particular, continues a multi-year decline in credit quality, with non-pass volumes climbing steadily as remote and hybrid work models depress occupancy and rental rates. Hotel and Lodging, along with certain other categories, also show rising stress, while the Retail sub-sector has seen some improvement.1
Table 3: Risk Profile of 2024 SNC Focus Industries

Industry	2023 SM + Classified Rate (%)	2024 SM + Classified Rate (%)	Trend
Technology, Telecom, and Media	19.3%	19.7%	Stable/High
Commercial Services	14.8%	17.4%	Increasing
Health Care and Pharmaceuticals	14.4%	14.4%	Stable/High
Materials & Commodities (ex. Oil & Gas)	12.3%	12.4%	Increasing
Commercial Real Estate & Construction	8.2%	8.2%	Stable (with severe sub-sector stress)
Source: 2024 SNC Report, Exhibit 6 1				
This sectoral analysis provides clear direction for supervisory focus, pointing examiners toward the specific industries and sub-sectors where underwriting assumptions are failing and credit quality is deteriorating most rapidly.

Section 2.4: The Shifting Ownership of Risk: Banks vs. Nonbanks

The modern credit landscape is characterized by an "originate-to-distribute" model, where regulated banks often originate loans and then sell them, particularly the riskier portions, to nonbank financial institutions such as private credit funds, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and other investment vehicles. The 2024 SNC report confirms that this distribution of risk remains a dominant feature of the market, but it also reveals a subtle and concerning counter-trend.
The primary dichotomy is stark: nonbanks hold a massively disproportionate share of the risk. Despite holding only 20.3% of total SNC commitments, nonbanks hold 59.6% of all non-pass (SM and Classified) commitments. Their internal non-pass rate is an extremely high 26.8%, compared to much lower rates of 4.7% for U.S. Banks and 4.6% for Foreign Banking Organizations (FBOs).1
This data confirms that the originate-to-distribute model has successfully moved a significant volume of high-risk assets outside the perimeter of the regulated banking system. However, the 2024 data reveals a potential leak in this containment wall. While nonbanks still hold the majority of problem loans, the share of non-pass exposure held by regulated entities (U.S. Banks and FBOs combined) increased from 35.0% in 2023 to 40.4% in 2024.1
This "re-onboarding" of risk onto bank balance sheets is a critical development. It suggests that as credit quality deteriorates and investor appetite for risky assets wanes, banks may be facing greater difficulty in syndicating newly originated loans. They may be left holding more of the risk than intended, a phenomenon known as a "hung" syndication. Furthermore, banks typically retain the revolving credit facilities associated with term loans sold to nonbanks. As leveraged companies become distressed, they are likely to draw down on these revolvers for liquidity, increasing the bank's funded exposure at the precise moment the borrower's risk profile is worsening. This trend indicates that risk intended for the nonbank market is flowing back into the regulated system, a development that will undoubtedly attract intense supervisory scrutiny.
Table 4: Distribution of SNC Commitments and Non-Pass Exposures by Lender Type (2024)

Lender Type	Share of Total Commitments (%)	Share of Non-Pass Commitments (%)	Risk Concentration Ratio (Share of Non-Pass / Share of Total)
U.S. Banks	45.8%	23.4%	0.51
Foreign Banking Organizations (FBOs)	33.9%	17.0%	0.50
Nonbanks	20.3%	59.6%	2.94
Source: Calculated from 2024 SNC Report, Exhibits 8 & 9 1				
The "Risk Concentration Ratio" in Table 4 quantifies this disparity. A ratio of 1.0 would indicate that a lender type holds risk in proportion to its overall market share. The ratios for U.S. Banks and FBOs are approximately 0.5, showing they hold less risk than their market share would suggest. The ratio for Nonbanks is nearly 3.0, illustrating their immense concentration in higher-risk assets.

Part III: Synthesis and Areas of Supervisory Focus for the Fall 2025 Examination

The upcoming Fall 2025 examination cycle will be conducted against the backdrop of the trends and pressures identified in the 2024 SNC report. Examiners will synthesize the timeless principles of credit risk management articulated in the Comptroller's Handbook with the contemporary evidence of market stress. The objective will be to determine if banks are proactively and accurately identifying, measuring, and managing the evolving risk in their portfolios. This synthesis points to several clear areas of heightened supervisory focus.

Section 3.1: Connecting Macro Headwinds to Borrower Repayment Capacity

The foundational principle of any credit risk rating is the assessment of the borrower's ability to repay debt from its "primary repayment source," which must be a sustainable source of cash.1 The 2024 SNC report explicitly identifies the "pressures of higher interest rates" and "compressed operating margins" as the primary drivers of credit deterioration.1 This creates a direct and unavoidable link between the current macroeconomic environment and the core of the regulatory credit evaluation process.
In the Fall 2025 cycle, examiners will move beyond theoretical discussions of these headwinds. They will demand to see tangible evidence that banks have incorporated these pressures into their credit analysis and risk ratings. The focus will be on the following:
●	Credibility of Projections: Any financial analysis that relies on a swift return to a low-interest-rate environment or a reversion to pre-2022 profit margins will be deemed unrealistic and challenged. Examiners will expect to see updated, credible financial projections that explicitly model the impact of sustained higher debt service costs and ongoing margin pressure on a borrower's cash flow.
●	Stress Testing: The analysis of projections must include robust, multi-scenario stress tests that assess a borrower's ability to perform under downside conditions.1 A simple "most likely case" will be insufficient. Examiners will want to see break-even analyses and an understanding of a borrower's resilience to further economic shocks.
●	Forward-Looking Analysis: The entire evaluation must be forward-looking, assessing the borrower's expected performance over at least the next 12 months.1 A rating based on strong historical performance that ignores clear and present headwinds will be criticized as untimely and inaccurate.
The central question examiners will ask is: Has the bank's analysis and risk rating fully accounted for the borrower's demonstrated ability to service its debt obligations under the current and foreseeable adverse economic conditions?

Section 3.2: Examination Focus Area 1: Underwriting and Structural Integrity in Leveraged Loans

Given that leveraged loans represent 84% of all classified SNC commitments, this segment will be subject to the most intense scrutiny.1 Examiners will use the list of "structural weakness elements" from Appendix F of the Comptroller's Handbook as a direct audit tool to dissect the "layered risks" identified in the SNC report.1
The defense that weak structures are simply "market standard" will be summarily rejected. The Handbook explicitly empowers examiners to criticize "fundamental underwriting flaws because they have become the 'competitive norm'".1 The SNC report now provides the definitive market evidence that these prevalent weak structures are contributing directly to rising classified assets. Therefore, examiners have both the regulatory mandate and the empirical evidence to classify these underwriting practices as unsafe and unsound, regardless of their prevalence in a competitive market.
Specific points of scrutiny will include:
●	Aggressive Repayment Assumptions: Loans with repayment predicated on "projected refinancing or recapitalization" or optimistic, unsupported cash flow growth will be heavily criticized.1 The analysis will be grounded in historical performance and realistic, stressed projections.
●	High Leverage: Leverage levels will be assessed not just against peer groups but against the borrower's tangible capacity to de-lever through operations. Loans with no clear path to de-leveraging will be viewed as containing excessive risk.
●	Weak or Nonexistent Covenants: The absence of meaningful financial covenants in high-risk leveraged loans will be cited as a critical failure of risk management. Covenants are the bank's primary tool for early intervention, and their absence in a deteriorating environment is an unacceptable structural weakness.1 Examiners will also scrutinize instances where covenants have been repeatedly waived or amended to accommodate a borrower's deteriorating performance, as this can mask the true level of risk.

Section 3.3: Examination Focus Area 2: Sector-Specific Risk Assessment and Collateral Valuation

Supervisory attention will be concentrated on the "Focus Industries" identified in the SNC report, with examination procedures tailored to the specific risks inherent in each sector.
●	Commercial Real Estate - Office: With non-pass commitments climbing, the focus will shift decisively to collateral dependency. The primary repayment source (rental income) is impaired for many properties. Therefore, examiners will demand updated, "as-is" appraisals that reflect current market realities of high vacancy, depressed rental rates, and increased tenant improvement costs. "Going concern" valuations will be rejected.1 Examiners will rigorously apply the Handbook's guidance on collateral valuation and split ratings. They will expect banks to classify the portion of the loan supported by the net realizable value of the collateral as Substandard, and to classify the unsecured shortfall as Doubtful or Loss, requiring appropriate charge-offs or reserves.1
●	Technology, Telecom, and Media: For growth-oriented companies in this sector, particularly those that are not yet profitable, the focus will be on cash burn rates and the viability of their business models in a capital-constrained world. The primary repayment source is often future equity or debt financing. Projections based on continued easy access to venture capital or public equity markets will be deemed speculative and unrealistic.1 The analysis will revert to fundamentals: Does the company have a credible path to sustainable, positive operating cash flow?
●	Commercial Services and Health Care: Many loans in these sectors are to companies sponsored by private equity, and thus are often highly leveraged. The examination focus will be on the same "layered risks" as other leveraged loans, with particular attention paid to the ability of these service-based businesses to maintain margins in the face of rising labor costs and other inflationary pressures. The stability of their revenue streams and the quality of their customer base will be critically assessed.

Section 3.4: Examination Focus Area 3: Scrutiny of Risk Rating Accuracy and Process Controls

The significant migration of credits from Special Mention to Classified status will trigger deep-dive reviews of the accuracy and timeliness of banks' internal risk ratings. A primary question will be: Why were these deteriorating credits not identified and downgraded sooner? This line of inquiry will lead to intense testing of the bank's internal control framework for the risk rating process, as outlined in the Comptroller's Handbook.1
Examiners will investigate the root causes of any significant rating inaccuracies (generally defined as greater than 5% of the number of credits reviewed or 3% of the dollar amount).1 The focus will be on the effectiveness of key controls:
●	Credit Review: Is the independent credit review function sufficiently staffed with experienced personnel? Is it empowered to challenge the ratings assigned by relationship managers and line-of-business personnel? Is its scope of review adequate for the complexity of the portfolio? The effectiveness of this function is a critical control point for ensuring rating objectivity.1
●	Management Information Systems (MIS): Do the bank's MIS reports provide management and the board with early warning indicators? Examiners will look for reports that track metrics such as the volume of "double downgrades," the velocity of rating changes, and rating changes stratified by loan officer, business line, and location. The absence of such dynamic reporting is a control deficiency.1
●	Back-Testing: For banks using quantitative models, are those models being back-tested to ensure their predictive power is confirmed by actual experience? For all systems, do credits with more severe ratings consistently exhibit higher default and loss rates? The system must be able to effectively rank-order risk.1
●	Incentives and Culture: Examiners will be alert for disincentives to accurate ratings. This includes compensation programs that may encourage lenders to understate risk to boost reported risk-adjusted returns or to generate new business by offering lower risk-based pricing. A credit culture that tolerates rating inaccuracy or unfounded optimism will be subject to severe criticism.1

Section 3.5: Concluding Recommendations: Proactive Risk Management for a New Era

The confluence of regulatory principles and market evidence points to a clear set of expectations for the Fall 2025 examination cycle. The era of benign credit conditions has ended, and the underwriting assumptions of that era are being invalidated. The "test" of weakly structured leveraged loans is underway, collateral values in key sectors are under pressure, and the accuracy of risk identification is paramount.
To prepare for this heightened level of scrutiny, financial institutions are advised to undertake the following proactive measures:
●	Conduct Proactive Portfolio Reviews: Do not wait for examiners to identify problems. Institutions should immediately initiate targeted reviews of their most vulnerable portfolios, particularly leveraged loans and credits in the identified Focus Industries (CRE-Office, Technology, etc.). These credits should be re-underwritten using conservative, current-day assumptions about interest rates, profit margins, and asset values.
●	Challenge Internal Ratings: Senior management and the board should empower the independent credit review function to aggressively challenge optimistic ratings assigned by the line of business. The institutional culture must shift from defending ratings to finding the right rating. Downgrades must be executed promptly when a borrower's risk profile changes, not after a default has occurred.
●	Shore Up Structural Protections: For all new originations and any loan restructurings, banks must reverse the trend of weakening underwriting standards. This means insisting on meaningful financial covenants that provide early warnings, realistic amortization schedules that lead to de-leveraging, and adequate collateral protection where appropriate.
●	Prepare for Deeper Dives: Banks should ensure that all credit files, particularly for high-risk exposures, contain pristine documentation. This includes robust, well-supported cash flow projections and credible, up-to-date collateral valuations. Management must be prepared to defend every critical assumption in their analysis with data and logic, as they will undoubtedly be challenged.
The institutions that successfully navigate the upcoming examination cycle will be those that demonstrate they have recognized the paradigm shift in the credit environment and have proactively aligned their risk management practices with the enduring principles of safety and soundness.
