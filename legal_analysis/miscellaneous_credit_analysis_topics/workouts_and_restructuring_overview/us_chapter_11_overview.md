# U.S. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy: Overview for Leveraged Lending

When out-of-court workouts are not feasible or fail, U.S. companies with leveraged capital structures may utilize Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 11 provides a court-supervised framework for company reorganization, allowing a debtor to continue operating its business while it develops and negotiates a plan to restructure its debts and repay creditors over time.

*(This document will be developed based on Section IV.B.1: U.S. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy: Key Features for Leveraged Lending, from the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" document.)*

## I. Key Features of Chapter 11 Relevant to Leveraged Lending

1.  **Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) Operation:**
    *   Upon filing for Chapter 11, the company's existing management typically remains in control of the business as the "debtor-in-possession" (DIP).
    *   The DIP has the powers and duties of a bankruptcy trustee and can continue to operate the business in the ordinary course, subject to court oversight and Bankruptcy Code limitations.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [100]

2.  **Automatic Stay:**
    *   A crucial protection that takes effect immediately upon the Chapter 11 filing.
    *   It halts virtually all collection efforts, litigation, foreclosure actions, and other proceedings by pre-petition creditors against the debtor and its property.
    *   Provides the debtor with a "breathing spell" to stabilize operations, develop a Plan of Reorganization, and negotiate with creditors.
    *   Secured creditors may seek "relief from the stay" from the court under certain circumstances (e.g., if their collateral is not adequately protected by the debtor or is not necessary for an effective reorganization).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [89]

3.  **DIP Financing (New Money):**
    *   Debtors in Chapter 11 often require new financing (DIP financing) to fund operations, stabilize the business, and cover administrative costs during the bankruptcy case.
    *   The Bankruptcy Code allows the DIP to obtain credit with court approval.
    *   To incentivize DIP lenders (who may include existing pre-petition lenders or new third-party lenders), they can be granted special protections, such as:
        *   **Superpriority administrative expense claims:** Ranking ahead of other administrative expenses and unsecured claims.
        *   **Priming liens:** Liens on existing collateral that can rank senior or equal to pre-petition liens, provided the pre-petition secured creditors whose liens are primed are given "adequate protection" for their interests.
    *   DIP financing is critical for the success of many reorganizations.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [89]

4.  **Plan of Reorganization (PoR):**
    *   The central goal of a Chapter 11 case is the proposal, confirmation, and implementation of a Plan of Reorganization.
    *   The PoR outlines how different classes of creditor claims and equity interests will be treated (e.g., paid in full, impaired by receiving less than full payment or altered terms, converted to equity in the reorganized company, or discharged).
    *   It also details how the debtor's business will be restructured and continue post-emergence from bankruptcy.
    *   The debtor initially has an "exclusivity period" to file a PoR, after which other parties in interest (like creditors) may be able to propose competing plans.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [100]

5.  **Classification of Claims and Interests:**
    *   The PoR must classify claims and interests into different groups of substantially similar claims (e.g., secured claims by collateral type/priority, priority unsecured claims, general unsecured claims, subordinated claims, equity interests).
    *   Only impaired classes (those not receiving full payment or whose rights are altered) are entitled to vote on the PoR.

6.  **Disclosure Statement:**
    *   Before soliciting votes on a PoR, the plan proponent must provide creditors and interest holders with a court-approved Disclosure Statement.
    *   This document must contain "adequate information" about the debtor, its business, the reasons for bankruptcy, the terms of the PoR, and alternatives to the plan, to enable informed voting.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [101]

7.  **Voting and Confirmation of the Plan:**
    *   Each impaired class of claims or interests votes on the PoR.
    *   **Acceptance by a Class:** A class of claims accepts the plan if approved by creditors holding at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more than one-half in number of the allowed claims in that class that actually vote. For a class of interests (equity), it's two-thirds in amount of interests that vote.
    *   **Court Confirmation:** After voting, the Bankruptcy Court holds a confirmation hearing to determine if the PoR meets all statutory requirements for confirmation (e.g., feasibility, proposed in good faith, best interests of creditors test).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [101]

8.  **Cramdown:**
    *   If one or more impaired classes reject the PoR, it can still be confirmed by the court under the "cramdown" provisions if certain conditions are met.
    *   Key requirements for cramdown:
        *   At least one impaired class of claims must vote to accept the plan (excluding votes of insiders).
        *   The plan must not "discriminate unfairly" against dissenting classes.
        *   The plan must be "fair and equitable" with respect to each dissenting impaired class. This often involves satisfying the **Absolute Priority Rule**, which generally requires that senior classes be paid in full before any junior class can receive or retain any property under the plan (unless the senior class consents to different treatment).
    *   Cramdown is a powerful tool to overcome holdout creditors but involves complex legal standards.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [67], [101]

9.  **Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases:**
    *   The DIP has the power, subject to court approval, to **assume** (agree to continue performing), **reject** (breach and terminate), or **assign** most pre-petition executory contracts (contracts where both sides still have material performance obligations) and unexpired leases.
    *   This allows the debtor to shed burdensome contracts and leases or retain beneficial ones, which is crucial for operational restructuring.
    *   Rejection of a contract gives rise to a pre-petition unsecured claim for damages for the counterparty.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [88]

10. **Sale of Assets (Section 363 Sales):**
    *   Chapter 11 allows the DIP to sell assets outside the ordinary course of business under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, subject to court approval.
    *   Assets can often be sold "free and clear" of existing liens, claims, and encumbrances, with such interests attaching to the sale proceeds.
    *   363 sales can be a quick way to maximize value for the estate, particularly for specific business lines or assets, sometimes used as an alternative to a full PoR.
    *   "Stalking horse" bidders and auction processes are common.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section IV.B.1, referencing [71]

## II. Implications for Leveraged Loan Lenders

*   Chapter 11 can significantly alter lenders' rights and recoveries.
*   Secured lenders' liens are generally respected, but valuation of collateral and "adequate protection" become key issues.
*   Unsecured lenders face greater uncertainty.
*   The process can be lengthy and expensive, involving active participation from lenders and their advisors.
*   Lenders may form official or ad hoc committees to represent their interests.

Chapter 11 provides a structured but complex environment for reorganizing highly leveraged companies, offering tools for both debtors and creditors to negotiate and implement solutions to financial distress.

*(This document will be further elaborated with details on specific aspects like adequate protection, claim valuation, and the role of creditor committees, based on Section IV.B.1 and general bankruptcy principles.)*
