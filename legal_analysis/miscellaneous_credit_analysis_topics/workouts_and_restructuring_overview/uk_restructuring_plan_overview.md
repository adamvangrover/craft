# UK Restructuring Plan (Part 26A Companies Act 2006): A "Super Scheme" with Cross-Class Cramdown

The **UK Restructuring Plan**, introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (CIGA 2020) as Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006, is a significant development in UK restructuring law. It provides a court-supervised process for companies in financial distress to implement a compromise or arrangement with their creditors and/or members. While building on the well-established UK Scheme of Arrangement (Part 26 Companies Act 2006), the Restructuring Plan includes a powerful **cross-class cramdown** mechanism, making it a more flexible and potent tool for complex restructurings, including those involving multi-layered leveraged finance capital structures. It is sometimes referred to as a "super scheme."

## I. Key Features of the UK Restructuring Plan

1.  **Eligibility and Purpose:** (Source Document: Section IV.B.2, [104])
    *   A company (UK registered or an overseas company with a "sufficient connection" to the UK) that "has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern" can propose a Restructuring Plan.
    *   The purpose of the plan must be to eliminate, reduce, prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial difficulties.
    *   Its availability to overseas companies (if sufficient connection is established, e.g., via English law finance documents, UK assets, or centre of main interests) makes it an attractive tool for international restructurings.

2.  **Court-Supervised Process (Two Hearings):** (Source Document: Section IV.B.2)
    *   The process is similar to a Scheme of Arrangement and involves two key court hearings before the English High Court (or Scottish Court of Session):
        *   **Convening Hearing (First Hearing):** The company applies to the court for an order permitting it to convene meetings of its creditors and/or members (shareholders) to vote on the proposed plan. At this stage, the court considers:
            *   **Class Composition:** How creditors and/or members are divided into different classes for voting purposes. The general principle is that a class should comprise those whose rights (as they are proposed to be affected by the plan) are "not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest." Class constitution is often a critical and potentially contentious aspect.
            *   **Jurisdictional Issues:** Whether the company is eligible to use the Restructuring Plan and whether the English court has (or should exercise) jurisdiction.
            *   **Adequacy of Disclosure:** Ensuring that sufficient information (an explanatory statement) will be provided to affected creditors/members to enable them to make an informed decision about the plan.
        *   **Sanction Hearing (Second Hearing):** If the proposed plan is approved by the requisite majority in each class (or if cross-class cramdown is sought and its conditions are met), the company returns to court to seek its sanction (approval) of the plan. At this stage, the court will consider:
            *   Whether the statutory requirements (e.g., voting thresholds, proper meeting procedures) have been met.
            *   The overall fairness of the plan to all affected parties.
            *   Whether the conditions for cross-class cramdown (see below) are satisfied, if applicable.
            *   Whether a person of ordinary commercial intelligence would approve the plan.
            *   The court retains ultimate discretion to sanction the plan even if all voting thresholds are met.

3.  **Voting Thresholds:** (Source Document: Section IV.B.2, [72], [104])
    *   For each class of creditors or members to approve the plan, a majority representing **75% in value** of those present and voting (in person or by proxy) in that class must vote in favor of the plan.
    *   **No Numerosity Requirement:** Notably, and unlike a Scheme of Arrangement, there is **no requirement for a majority in number** (i.e., more than 50% of those voting) within each class to also vote in favor. This removal of the "headcount test" can make it easier to get approval from classes with many small-value creditors who might otherwise block a scheme.

4.  **Cross-Class Cramdown (The Key Innovation):** (Source Document: Section IV.B.2, [72])
    *   This is the most significant feature distinguishing the Restructuring Plan from a traditional Scheme of Arrangement. A plan can be sanctioned by the court and become binding on a **dissenting class** (a class that did not vote in favor by the 75% value threshold) if **two conditions** are met:
        *   **Condition A (Approval by an "In-the-Money" Class):** The court must be satisfied that, if the plan were sanctioned, at least one class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the "relevant alternative" (see below), has voted in favor of the plan by the 75% value threshold. This approving class cannot be the company itself or a person connected with it (unless the court directs otherwise).
        *   **Condition B ("No Worse Off" Test):** The court must be satisfied that **no member of any dissenting class(es) would be any worse off** under the Restructuring Plan than they would be in the event of the "relevant alternative."
    *   This cross-class cramdown power allows a restructuring to proceed even if some creditor classes (e.g., out-of-the-money junior creditors or equity holders who might otherwise hold up a Scheme) vote against it, provided the conditions are met and the court exercises its discretion to sanction the plan. This is a powerful tool for overcoming holdout creditors.

5.  **The "Relevant Alternative":** (Source Document: Section IV.B.2, [72])
    *   This is a crucial concept for both Condition A (identifying an "in-the-money" assenting class) and Condition B (the "no worse off" test) of the cross-class cramdown.
    *   It refers to **whatever the court considers would be the most likely outcome for the company if the Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned.**
    *   This "relevant alternative" is established by evidence presented to the court and could be, for example, administration, liquidation, a distressed sale, or another insolvency process.
    *   **Valuation evidence** is critical in establishing the relevant alternative and in assessing what each class of creditors/members would likely receive in that scenario, which is then compared to their treatment under the proposed Restructuring Plan for the "no worse off" test.

6.  **Exclusion of "Out-of-the-Money" Stakeholders from Voting (No Genuine Economic Interest):** (Source Document: Section IV.B.2)
    *   The Restructuring Plan provisions allow the company to apply to the court (at the convening hearing) to exclude from voting any class of creditors or members who, in the court's assessment, have **no genuine economic interest** in the company in the event of the "relevant alternative."
    *   This means if a class is so far "out-of-the-money" that they would receive nothing in the most likely alternative scenario (e.g., liquidation), they may be disenfranchised from voting on the plan, which can streamline the process.

7.  **Broad Scope of Application:**
    *   A Restructuring Plan can affect the rights of **secured creditors** (including partially secured creditors) and **unsecured creditors**, as well as **members (shareholders).** This is a broader potential reach than some other tools. (Source Document: Section IV.B.2, [103] implies this by referring to cramming up a super-senior class).
    *   It can be used to implement a wide range of restructuring solutions, including debt-for-equity swaps, haircutting debt principal or accrued interest, amending loan terms (maturities, interest rates, covenants), releasing guarantees and security, and more complex balance sheet reorganizations.

## II. Implications for Leveraged Loan Lenders and Stakeholders

*   **Powerful Tool for Complex Cases:** The cross-class cramdown feature makes the Restructuring Plan particularly useful for companies with complex, multi-layered capital structures (common in leveraged finance) where achieving unanimous consent or even individual class consent for a traditional Scheme of Arrangement might be difficult or impossible due to holdout creditors or divergent interests.
*   **Focus on Valuation and the "No Worse Off" Test:** For lenders involved in a Restructuring Plan (whether assenting or dissenting), close attention must be paid to the valuation evidence presented regarding the "relevant alternative" and how the "no worse off" test is applied to their specific class. This often involves detailed financial analysis and expert testimony.
*   **Potential to Bind Secured Creditors:** Unlike some traditional insolvency processes where secured creditor rights are paramount, a Restructuring Plan can, subject to the statutory safeguards (including the "no worse off" test and court discretion), bind secured creditors and even cram them down if an "in-the-money" junior or pari passu class approves the plan.
*   **International Recognition and Use:** While a UK domestic legal tool, efforts are often made to ensure that a sanctioned Restructuring Plan can be recognized and given effect in other relevant jurisdictions (e.g., through Chapter 15 recognition in the US) to bind international creditors and assets located overseas. Its use by overseas companies with sufficient UK connection further enhances its international profile.
*   **Strategic Considerations:** The introduction of the Restructuring Plan has added another significant strategic option for companies and creditors when considering how to address financial distress in the UK, sitting alongside Schemes of Arrangement, Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), and formal insolvency procedures like administration and liquidation.

The UK Restructuring Plan has quickly become a prominent feature of the European restructuring landscape, offering a flexible and potentially very powerful court-supervised alternative to traditional insolvency routes for companies needing to implement complex financial restructurings that might otherwise be blocked by certain creditor groups. Its development and early case law continue to be closely watched by restructuring professionals globally.
This version provides a more detailed explanation of each feature of the UK Restructuring Plan, particularly eligibility, the two-hearing court process, voting thresholds (emphasizing the absence of numerosity), the mechanics and conditions of cross-class cramdown, the concept of the "relevant alternative," and the exclusion of out-of-the-money stakeholders.
