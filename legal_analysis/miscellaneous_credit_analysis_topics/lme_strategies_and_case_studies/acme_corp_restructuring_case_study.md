# LME Case Study: The Restructuring of Acme Corp.

## 1. Background

Acme Corp. is a legacy retailer that has faced significant disruption from e-commerce. In early 2023, the company was struggling with a heavy debt load and declining revenues, leading to a credit rating downgrade to CCC.

### Key Parties:
*   **Acme Corp.:** The borrower.
*   **First Lien Lenders:** A syndicate of banks holding senior secured debt.
*   **Bondholders:** A group of institutional investors holding unsecured bonds.
*   **New Money Investors:** A private equity firm willing to inject new capital in exchange for control.

## 2. The Restructuring Proposal

The company, in negotiation with the New Money Investors, proposed a transaction that would:
1.  **"Prime" the Existing Debt:** The New Money Investors would provide a new super-senior loan that would have priority over all existing debt.
2.  **Exchange Offer:** The First Lien Lenders would be offered the opportunity to exchange their existing debt for new debt with a lower principal amount but a higher interest rate.
3.  **Equity Conversion:** The Bondholders would have their debt converted into a small amount of equity in the reorganized company.

## 3. Legal and Creditor Conflicts

The proposal triggered significant conflict among the creditor groups:

*   **First Lien Lenders' Argument:** They argued that the transaction violated the "sacred rights" in their credit agreement, which required unanimous consent for any action that would subordinate their claims.
*   **Bondholders' Argument:** They argued that the transaction was a fraudulent conveyance designed to benefit the New Money Investors at their expense.
*   **Company's Argument:** The company and the New Money Investors argued that the transaction was permissible under the terms of the credit agreement and was necessary to save the company from bankruptcy.

## 4. The Outcome

After months of contentious negotiations and legal battles, the parties reached a settlement that included:
*   A smaller super-senior loan than originally proposed.
*   A more favorable exchange offer for the First Lien Lenders.
*   A larger equity stake for the Bondholders.

## 5. Key Takeaways for Credit Analysts

*   **The Importance of Document Analysis:** A deep understanding of credit agreements is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities.
*   **Inter-creditor Dynamics:** Restructuring negotiations are often a multi-sided battle where different creditor groups have competing interests.
*   **The Rise of "Creditor-on-Creditor" Violence:** Sophisticated investors are increasingly using aggressive tactics to improve their position in a restructuring.
