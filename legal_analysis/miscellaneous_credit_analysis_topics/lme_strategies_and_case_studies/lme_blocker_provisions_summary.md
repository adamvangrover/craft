# Summary of LME "Blocker" Provisions in Leveraged Loan Agreements

Liability Management Exercises (LMEs) have driven a significant evolution in credit agreement drafting, leading to the development of specific protective covenants commonly referred to as **"Blocker Provisions."** These provisions are designed to prevent or mitigate the risks associated with common LME strategies that can disadvantage existing lenders, often by exploiting perceived loopholes or ambiguities in loan documentation. The nomenclature of these blockers frequently references the company whose LME highlighted the specific vulnerability the blocker seeks to address.

*(This document summarizes information from Section III.B: Case Studies in Liability Management and Resulting "Blocker" Provisions (J.Crew, Serta Simmons, Chewy/PetSmart, Envision Healthcare, Pluralsight, MyTheresa/Neiman Marcus) of the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" (Source Document), referencing [36], [55], [57].)*

## Key Types of LME Blocker Provisions:

1.  **"J.Crew Blockers" (Addressing Asset Drop-Downs to Unrestricted Subsidiaries, especially IP):**
    *   **Targeted LME Strategy:** Prevents the transfer of valuable assets, particularly Intellectual Property (IP) or other "crown jewel" assets, from the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries to Unrestricted Subsidiaries or other non-loan parties (entities not providing guarantees or collateral for the main facilities). This was highlighted by the J.Crew IP transfer.
    *   **Common Mechanisms:**
        *   Explicitly restricting or prohibiting the transfer/licensing of material IP or other specifically defined key assets to Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
        *   Imposing tighter monetary caps or specific limitations on the amount of Investments that can be made in, or other value (e.g., via Restricted Payments) that can be transferred to, Unrestricted Subsidiaries, especially if such transfers involve core operational assets or IP.
        *   Requiring that any subsidiary holding material IP (or other designated key assets) must remain a Restricted Subsidiary and a Guarantor under the credit agreement.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.1 (J.Crew)

2.  **"Serta Blockers" (Addressing Non-Pro Rata Uptiering/Priming Transactions):**
    *   **Targeted LME Strategy:** Prevents a majority lender group from facilitating amendments to the credit agreement that allow new priming (super-priority) debt which subordinates non-participating existing lenders, often by challenging narrow interpretations of "open market purchase" exceptions or amendment powers. This was central to the Serta Simmons litigation.
    *   **Common Mechanisms:**
        *   Requiring **unanimous or "all-affected lender" consent** for any amendment that effectively subordinates the claims or liens of existing lenders to new debt, or that alters the pro rata sharing of payments or collateral proceeds to their detriment (i.e., strengthening "sacred rights").
        *   Specifically **clarifying the definition of "open market purchases"** to explicitly exclude privately negotiated exchanges with only a subset of lenders, or requiring such purchases to be made through genuinely open, transparent market mechanisms available to all lenders in the class.
        *   Broadening **"sacred rights"** provisions to explicitly cover actions that *have the economic effect of* subordinating existing debt or liens, or altering pro rata distributions, not just direct textual amendments to payment or lien priority clauses.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.2 (Serta Simmons)

3.  **"Chewy Blockers" / "PetSmart Blockers" (Addressing Collateral Stripping via Stock Transfers & Automatic Lien/Guarantee Release Loopholes):**
    *   **Targeted LME Strategy:** Prevents the automatic release of subsidiary guarantees and collateral merely because a guarantor subsidiary ceases to be "wholly-owned" as a result of internal stock transfers to affiliates (e.g., a non-guarantor parent or an Unrestricted Subsidiary), as seen in the PetSmart/Chewy matter.
    *   **Common Mechanisms:**
        *   Providing that subsidiary guarantees and collateral will **not** be automatically released solely because a guarantor subsidiary ceases to be "wholly-owned" as a result of share transfers to an affiliate of the Borrower.
        *   Requiring that such releases of guarantees/collateral only occur in connection with a **bona fide sale** of the subsidiary or all/substantially all of its assets to a **non-affiliated third party** for fair market value.
        *   Limiting such releases only to situations where the subsidiary becomes an "Excluded Subsidiary" for other legitimate, pre-agreed reasons (e.g., due to regulatory prohibition on providing credit support) *other than* as a result of an internal reorganization or share transfer primarily designed to strip guarantees/collateral.
        *   Potentially including tighter controls or prohibitions on non-cash distributions or investments, particularly those involving the equity of material subsidiaries, if such actions could trigger these problematic release clauses.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.3 (Chewy/PetSmart)

4.  **"Envision Blockers" (Addressing Aggregation of Baskets for Unrestricted Subsidiary Investments/Designations):**
    *   **Targeted LME Strategy:** Prevents borrowers from aggregating capacity from multiple, often general-purpose, investment baskets or Restricted Payment baskets to fund large-scale transfers of assets to, or designations of, Unrestricted Subsidiaries, as was a concern in the Envision Healthcare LME.
    *   **Common Mechanisms:**
        *   Providing that **only a specific, clearly identified investment basket** (if any such basket is permitted at all for this purpose, and often with a tighter cap) can be used for Investments in, or the designation of, Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
        *   Explicitly **prohibiting the combination or "stacking"** of capacity from other general investment baskets, general Restricted Payment baskets, or other general purpose covenant allowances to fund such Unrestricted Subsidiary-related transfers or designations.
    *   **Holistic Approach:** "Envision Blockers" are often viewed as a more comprehensive protection, potentially incorporating elements of J.Crew blockers (protecting material assets) and Serta-like concepts (heightened consent for effective subordination via asset transfers), along with the specific focus on limiting the *sources* of basket capacity for Unrestricted Subsidiary activities.

5.  **"Pluralsight Blockers" (Addressing Asset Transfers to *Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries*):**
    *   **Targeted LME Strategy:** Guards against the transfer of material assets (especially IP) from loan parties (the Borrower and its Guarantors) to **non-loan parties.** This category of "non-loan party" is broadened to include not just Unrestricted Subsidiaries but also **Restricted Subsidiaries that are *non-guarantors***. These could be, for example, foreign subsidiaries where guarantees are problematic, non-wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are not required to provide guarantees, or other special purpose Restricted Subsidiaries that are carved out of the guarantee and collateral requirements applicable to other Restricted Subsidiaries. This was a concern in the Pluralsight LME.
    *   **Common Mechanisms:**
        *   Extending J.Crew-type protections (restrictions on transferring material IP/assets) to cover transfers to these types of non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries.
        *   Focusing on preventing valuable assets from being moved into entities that, while technically part of the Restricted Group, do *not* provide direct credit support (guarantees and collateral) to the main facility lenders, thereby diluting the effective collateral pool available to those lenders.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.5 (Pluralsight), [55], [57]

**General Characteristics and Implications of Blocker Provisions:**

*   **Reactive Development:** Blocker provisions are largely a market-driven, reactive development. They often arise, or are refined, in response to specific, novel, or aggressive LME techniques employed by borrowers and sponsors that expose weaknesses in prior documentation.
*   **Increasing Specificity and Complexity:** As LME strategies become more creative and sophisticated, the corresponding blocker provisions tend to become more detailed, specific, and targeted to address the particular mechanics of the LME they are designed to prevent. This contributes to the increasing complexity of credit agreements.
*   **Key Negotiation Points:** The inclusion, scope, and strength of blocker provisions are now significant negotiation points in the drafting of new credit agreements, reflecting the prevailing balance of power between lenders and borrowers/sponsors in the market at any given time.
*   **Not Always Foolproof:** While designed to protect lenders, even well-drafted blocker provisions can sometimes be circumvented by new, unforeseen LME structures or by interpretations of other interacting covenant provisions. This leads to a continuous "cat and mouse" dynamic between market participants. The effectiveness of any blocker depends heavily on its precise wording, its interaction with other covenant baskets and permissions, and the specific facts of any proposed transaction.

A thorough understanding of these evolving blocker provisions is crucial for lenders and investors to assess the true level of covenant protection afforded under a credit agreement in the face of potential aggressive liability management tactics by borrowers.
