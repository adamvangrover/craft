# LME Case Study: Chewy/PetSmart (2018) - Asset Shielding via Stock Transfers

The PetSmart LME involving its valuable subsidiary Chewy.com in 2018 demonstrated how borrowers could utilize a combination of Restricted Payment and Investment covenant baskets to transfer significant equity value in a key subsidiary outside the existing lenders' collateral net. This case also highlighted risks associated with automatic lien release provisions tied to "wholly-owned subsidiary" status.

*(This document will be developed based on Section III.B.3: Chewy (PetSmart) (2018): Stock Transfers, Restricted Payment/Investment Baskets, Collateral Impact, and "Chewy Blockers", from the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" document.)*

## I. Background

*   **Company:** PetSmart, a U.S. retailer of pet supplies and services.
*   **Key Asset:** Chewy.com, a rapidly growing online retailer of pet products, acquired by PetSmart. Chewy was a significant part of the collateral value supporting loans used to finance its acquisition by PetSmart.
*   **Date:** Transactions occurred around 2018.

## II. The Transaction (Multi-Step Stock Transfers)

PetSmart executed two key transfers of Chewy.com common stock, effectively moving a substantial portion of Chewy's equity outside the direct reach of PetSmart's secured lenders:

1.  **Distribution of 20% of Chewy Stock (Restricted Payment):**
    *   PetSmart distributed 20% of Chewy.com's stock to its ultimate parent holding company. This parent company was not a guarantor of PetSmart's debt.
    *   This transfer was justified by PetSmart as permissible by utilizing available capacity under its **Restricted Payment (RP) covenant baskets**. PetSmart claimed substantial capacity under these baskets, reportedly due to prior equity contributions made to the group.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.3, referencing [56]

2.  **Contribution of 16.5% of Chewy Stock to an Unrestricted Subsidiary (Investment):**
    *   PetSmart contributed another 16.5% of Chewy.com's stock to a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart.
    *   This new subsidiary was contemporaneously designated as an **Unrestricted Subsidiary.**
    *   This transfer was justified using available capacity under its **Investment covenant baskets.**
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.3, referencing [56]

**Combined Effect:** A total of 36.5% of Chewy.com's equity was moved to entities outside the direct PetSmart subsidiary chain that originally owned 100% of Chewy and was part of the credit group.

## III. Invocation of Automatic Lien Release

*   **"Wholly-Owned Subsidiary" Clause:** PetSmart's credit agreement contained a provision for the automatic release of guarantees and security from any subsidiary that "ceases to be a wholly-owned Subsidiary."
*   **PetSmart's Argument:** PetSmart then argued that because Chewy.com was no longer a "wholly-owned subsidiary" (due to the 36.5% of its stock now being held by the parent holding company and the new unrestricted subsidiary â€“ entities outside the direct chain of ownership that previously held 100%), this automatic lien release provision was triggered.
*   **Alleged Consequence:** According to PetSmart, this meant that all liens on Cheyen.com's assets were released, and Chewy's guarantee of PetSmart's debt was also released.
*   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.3, referencing [56]

## IV. Impact on Existing Lenders

*   **Loss of Collateral Value:** Secured lenders faced the potential loss of not only the direct collateral value of the 36.5% of Chewy.com shares that were transferred but, more critically, their entire security interest over Chewy.com's underlying assets if the automatic lien release argument held.
*   **Weakened Credit Support:** Chewy.com was a key and growing part of the PetSmart business, and its removal from the collateral package and as a guarantor significantly weakened the credit support for PetSmart's lenders.

## V. Legal Issues and Litigation

*   **Lender Challenge:** Lenders challenged PetSmart's actions and its interpretation of the covenant baskets and the automatic lien release provisions.
*   Arguments likely included that the baskets were not intended to permit such significant value leakage or the stripping of collateral and guarantees from a core subsidiary in this manner, and that the transfers might constitute fraudulent conveyances or breaches of good faith.
*   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.3, referencing [56]
*   **Outcome of Litigation:** The specifics of the litigation outcome are not fully detailed in the provided source [56]. However, the source [60] notes that Chewy eventually went public in 2019. The transaction highlighted the significant risks embedded in broadly defined covenant baskets and automatic lien/guarantee release provisions.

## VI. Development of "Chewy Blockers" (or PetSmart Blockers)

In response to this LME and similar maneuvers, new protective covenant language, often referred to as **"Chewy Blockers"** or **"PetSmart Blockers,"** emerged in credit documentation. These aim to prevent similar outcomes by:

*   **Preventing Automatic Release on Non-Wholly-Owned Status due to Affiliate Transfers:** Providing that subsidiary guarantees and collateral will **not** be automatically released solely because a guarantor subsidiary ceases to be "wholly-owned" as a result of a transfer of its shares to an affiliate (such as a parent company or an unrestricted subsidiary of the borrower).
*   **Requiring Bona Fide Third-Party Sales:** Stipulating that such releases of guarantees/collateral should only occur in connection with a bona fide sale of the subsidiary or its assets to a non-affiliated third party for fair market value.
*   **Limiting Release for Other "Excluded Subsidiary" Reasons:** Ensuring releases only occur if the subsidiary becomes an "excluded subsidiary" for legitimate reasons (e.g., regulatory prohibitions on providing credit support) other than a mere internal reorganization or share transfer designed to strip guarantees/collateral.
*   **Limiting Non-Cash Distributions/Investments:** Placing tighter controls on non-cash distributions or investments, particularly those involving the equity of material subsidiaries.
*   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.3, referencing [55]

The Chewy/PetSmart LME serves as a critical example of how covenant loopholes related to subsidiary status and asset transfers can be exploited, leading to the evolution of more robust protective language in subsequent credit agreements. It emphasized the need for lenders to scrutinize definitions of "wholly-owned," automatic release clauses, and the combined capacity of various covenant baskets.
