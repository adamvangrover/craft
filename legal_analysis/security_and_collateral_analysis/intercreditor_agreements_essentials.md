# Intercreditor Agreements: Essentials for Security Analysis

When a borrower has multiple layers of debt from different creditor groups (e.g., super senior lenders, senior secured lenders, second lien lenders, mezzanine lenders, bondholders), an Intercreditor Agreement (ICA) becomes essential. This document governs the relationship between these creditor classes, particularly concerning their rights to collateral and payments.

*(This document will be primarily based on Section II.F (Intercreditor Agreements) and Section II.G (Waterfall Provisions) of the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" document.)*

## I. What is an Intercreditor Agreement?

*   A legally binding contract entered into by the different classes of creditors, the borrower, and usually the guarantors.
*   Its main purpose is to define the relative priorities and rights of each creditor class with respect to:
    *   Claims against the borrower.
    *   Security over shared collateral.
    *   The process of enforcing that security.
    *   The distribution of enforcement proceeds.
    *   Behavior during insolvency proceedings.
*   It aims to prevent disputes and ensure an orderly process if the borrower encounters financial distress.

## II. Key Provisions in an Intercreditor Agreement

1.  **Definitions and Parties:**
    *   Clearly defines each class of debt (e.g., "Senior Debt," "Second Lien Debt," "Super Senior Debt") and the parties representing them (e.g., "Senior Agent," "Second Lien Agent").
    *   Specifies which debt documents are governed by the ICA.

2.  **Ranking of Debt and Liens (Priority):**
    *   **Lien Subordination:** Determines the priority of security interests over common collateral. For example, Second Lien creditors agree that their liens are subordinate to First Lien creditors' liens on shared collateral.
    *   **Payment Subordination (Debt Subordination):** May specify that junior debt holders cannot receive payments (principal or interest) until senior debt is paid, or only under certain conditions ("payment blockage" or "payment stop" provisions). This can apply to payments from any source, not just collateral proceeds.
    *   **Debt Caps:** May limit the amount of debt that can rank at a particular level of priority (e.g., a cap on the amount of Senior Debt).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.F, II.G

3.  **Application of Enforcement Proceeds (The Waterfall):**
    *   A detailed cascade dictating the order in which proceeds from the enforcement of shared security are distributed among the creditor classes, after costs of enforcement.
    *   E.g., Costs -> Super Senior -> Senior Secured -> Second Lien Secured -> etc.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.G

4.  **Control over Enforcement:**
    *   Specifies which creditor class (usually the most senior secured class, e.g., Senior Lenders acting via the Senior Agent) has the right to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the shared security and to control the enforcement process (e.g., timing, method of sale).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.F

5.  **Standstill Periods (Enforcement Standstill):**
    *   Provisions that prohibit junior creditors from taking enforcement action (e.g., accelerating their debt, appointing a receiver, petitioning for insolvency) for a specified period (e.g., 90-180 days or longer) after a default that also triggers senior rights.
    *   This gives senior creditors a clear window to manage a workout or initiate their own enforcement strategy.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.F

6.  **Release of Security and Guarantees:**
    *   Allows for the release of security or guarantees by the Security Agent upon instruction from the controlling class of creditors (typically seniors) in certain circumstances (e.g., permitted asset disposals, refinancing of senior debt). Junior creditors typically agree to be bound by such releases.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.F

7.  **Rights in Insolvency:**
    *   Regulates how creditor classes will act in formal insolvency proceedings (e.g., bankruptcy, administration):
        *   Voting on reorganization plans.
        *   Rights to provide Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) financing.
        *   Challenges to other creditors' claims or security (often with "no challenge" clauses).
        *   Turnover provisions (requiring junior creditors to hand over any "out-of-order" payments received to senior creditors).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.F

8.  **Permitted Payments to Junior Creditors:**
    *   The ICA may restrict or permit payments (principal, interest, fees) on junior debt tranches, often conditional upon no senior default and/or compliance with financial covenants.

9.  **Amendments and Waivers to Finance Documents:**
    *   May restrict the ability of the borrower and one class of creditors to amend their underlying finance documents in a way that would adversely affect other creditor classes without their consent.

10. **Buy-Out Options (less common, but can exist):**
    *   Rights for one class of creditors to purchase the claims of another class under certain conditions.

## III. Why ICAs are Crucial for Security Analysis

*   **True Priority:** The ICA, not just the individual security documents, determines the *actual* priority and recovery prospects from shared collateral.
*   **Control:** Understanding who controls enforcement is key to predicting how a distress scenario will unfold.
*   **Value Leakage:** ICAs aim to prevent value from leaking to junior stakeholders in a way that disadvantages senior creditors.
*   **Negotiation Points:** The terms of an ICA are heavily negotiated and reflect the relative bargaining power of the different creditor groups. "Lender-friendly" vs. "borrower-friendly" or "junior-friendly" ICAs can exist.

## IV. LMA Standard Forms

*   The Loan Market Association (LMA) publishes standard form ICAs (e.g., for super senior RCF/senior structures, or first lien/second lien structures). These serve as a starting point for negotiations.
*   *Source Reference:* Section II.F

Analyzing the ICA is as important as analyzing the credit agreement itself when assessing secured leveraged loans with multiple debt tranches.
