# Covenant Terminology in Leveraged Loans

This document defines key terms central to understanding loan covenants in leveraged finance, drawing primarily from Section II.D (Covenants: Protecting Lender Interests and Borrower Operational Flexibility) and related discussions in the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" (Source Document).

*   **Covenant:**
    *   *Definition:* Contractual promises made by the borrower (and guarantors) within the credit agreement to conduct its business in a certain manner (affirmative covenants), to refrain from specific actions (negative covenants), or to maintain its financial condition within certain parameters (financial covenants) throughout the term of the loan.
    *   *Purpose:* A primary tool for lenders to mitigate credit risk, monitor the borrower's performance and financial condition, protect their interests post-closing, and provide mechanisms to intervene if credit quality deteriorates. A breach typically constitutes a technical default, which can escalate into an Event of Default.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section I.C, II.D, referencing [6], [46]

*   **Affirmative Covenants (Positive Covenants):**
    *   *Definition:* Stipulate actions that the borrower *must* perform or conditions it *must* maintain. Their purpose is often to ensure the borrower operates prudently, maintains its legal status and assets, and provides lenders with ongoing information.
    *   *Common Examples:* Maintenance of legal existence; payment of taxes; compliance with laws (environmental, anti-corruption, sanctions); maintenance of properties and insurance; provision of financial statements (annual audited, quarterly unaudited), compliance certificates, notices of default.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.1, Table 2, referencing [6]

*   **Negative Covenants:**
    *   *Definition:* Restrict the borrower from undertaking certain actions without obtaining prior consent from the lenders (or a specified majority). Aim to prevent actions that could increase lenders' risk, diminish collateral value, or leak value out of the restricted group.
    *   *Common Examples:* Limitations on Indebtedness, Liens (Negative Pledge), Asset Sales (Disposals), Investments/Loans/Acquisitions, Restricted Payments, Mergers, Changes to Business, Transactions with Affiliates. (See detailed definitions below).
    *   *Permitted Baskets/Allowances:* Negotiated exceptions, fixed amounts, or ratio-based permissions within negative covenants that allow the borrower to undertake otherwise restricted actions. "Grower baskets" (expanding with EBITDA/assets) and "builder baskets" (accumulating capacity based on net income/equity) can create significant flexibility.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.1, II.D.2, Table 2, referencing [6], [21]

*   **Financial Covenants:**
    *   *Definition:* Require the borrower to maintain its financial condition and performance within certain pre-agreed, numerically-defined parameters, tested periodically (maintenance) or upon specific events (incurrence). Serve as key early warning indicators.
    *   *Common Examples:* Leverage Ratio (Total Debt/EBITDA), Interest Coverage Ratio (EBITDA/Interest Expense), Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Cash Flow Cover Ratio, Capital Expenditure (Capex) Limitation.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section I.C, II.D.1, II.D.3, Table 2, referencing [4], [6]

*   **Maintenance Covenants:**
    *   *Definition:* Financial covenants that require regular, periodic testing (e.g., quarterly at each period end), regardless of whether the borrower is taking any particular action. A breach usually constitutes an Event of Default (or a Default that can ripen into one), allowing lenders to act even if no payment default has occurred.
    *   *Typical Context:* Traditional in bank lending, LMA Term Loan A (TLA) facilities.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.1, II.D.3, Table 2, referencing [4]

*   **Incurrence Covenants:**
    *   *Definition:* Financial covenants that are tested *only* when the borrower proposes to undertake a specific action otherwise restricted by a negative covenant (e.g., incurring additional debt, making an acquisition, paying a dividend). If the borrower can demonstrate that, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the proposed action, it would be in compliance with the relevant financial ratio, the action is permitted.
    *   *Typical Context:* Characteristic of high-yield bonds and have become prevalent in "covenant-lite" Term Loan B (TLB) facilities. Provide greater operational flexibility to borrowers.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.1, II.D.3, Table 2, referencing [4]

*   **Covenant-Lite / Covenant-Loose:**
    *   *Definition:*
        *   **Covenant-Lite:** A loan (typically a TLB) that contains no financial maintenance covenants applicable to the term loan lenders. Lenders rely primarily on negative covenants and default triggers like non-payment. (Referencing [4])
        *   **Covenant-Loose:** Might include one financial maintenance covenant (often a leverage ratio), but it might be set with very generous headroom or may only "spring" into effect for the benefit of revolving credit facility (RCF) lenders when RCF drawings exceed a specified threshold (e.g., 30-40% of commitments). For term loan lenders, this effectively behaves like a covenant-lite facility unless the RCF springing covenant is triggered and breached. (Referencing [6])
    *   *Market Trend:* Widespread adoption in the TLB market, driven by sponsor demand and liquid market conditions, transferring operational freedom to borrowers but delaying potential lender intervention.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section I.A, II.B.1, II.D.3

*   **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):**
    *   *Definition:* A critical financial metric, not formally defined under GAAP/IFRS but contractually defined in credit agreements. It forms the basis for most financial ratio calculations (e.g., leverage, interest coverage). Its definition, particularly permissible "add-backs," is invariably subject to intense negotiation.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section I.C, II.D.3, referencing [5], [13]

*   **EBITDA Add-backs / Adjustments:**
    *   *Definition:* Specific items that borrowers (especially those backed by private equity sponsors) are permitted by the credit agreement to add back to (or deduct from) reported earnings to arrive at the contractually defined "Adjusted EBITDA" or "Covenant EBITDA" used for financial ratio calculations.
    *   *Common Examples:* Synergies and cost savings anticipated from acquisitions or restructurings (often permitted even if not yet fully realized, subject to time limits or caps), restructuring charges, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, transaction costs, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash charges.
    *   *Impact:* Can significantly increase reported EBITDA compared to actual cash-generating earnings, potentially obscuring true financial performance and delaying the tripping of financial covenants. The permissiveness of these add-backs is a key negotiation point.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section I.C, II.D.3, referencing [5], [6], [13]

*   **Equity Cure:**
    *   *Definition:* Provisions in many leveraged loan agreements (particularly sponsor-backed) allowing the private equity sponsor or other equity holders to "cure" a breach of a financial maintenance covenant by making an equity contribution to the borrower.
    *   *Mechanism:* The proceeds of this equity injection are then typically treated, for the purpose of recalculating the breached covenant for that specific testing period, as an addition to EBITDA or, less commonly, as a reduction of debt.
    *   *Limitations:* Usually subject to limitations, such as the number of times they can be exercised during the life of the loan (e.g., no more than 4-5 times in total) or within a given period (e.g., not in consecutive quarters, or no more than two cures in any four-quarter period). The "cured" EBITDA may or may not be allowed for other calculations (e.g., baskets).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.3, referencing [6]

*   **Restricted Subsidiary:**
    *   *Definition:* Subsidiaries of the borrower that are bound by the full covenant package of the credit agreement (unless otherwise specified). They typically form the core "credit group" and are usually required to provide guarantees for the borrower's obligations and grant security over their assets. The financial results of restricted subsidiaries are consolidated with those of the borrower for financial covenant calculations and determining capacity under various baskets.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.4, referencing [21]

*   **Unrestricted Subsidiary:**
    *   *Definition:* Subsidiaries specifically designated by the borrower (to the extent permitted by the credit agreement) to be outside the scope of most of the credit agreement's covenants and obligations.
    *   *Implications:* They do not provide guarantees or grant security for the main credit facilities. Their financial performance is typically excluded from the restricted group's consolidated covenant calculations. Transactions between the restricted group and unrestricted subsidiaries are generally treated as investments or affiliate transactions subject to relevant covenant limitations.
    *   *Strategic Use/Risk:* Can be used for legitimate operational flexibility (JVs, non-core assets) but have also been central to controversial Liability Management Exercises (LMEs) involving asset transfers (e.g., J.Crew, MyTheresa, Envision) to shield assets or raise new, structurally senior debt. This has led to "blocker" provisions.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.4, III.A, III.B, referencing [21], [36], [52]

*   **Restricted Payments (RP Covenant) / Limitation on Restricted Payments:**
    *   *Definition:* A key negative covenant that governs the ability of the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to make payments or distributions that move value outside the "credit box" (the restricted group).
    *   *"Restricted Payments" Typically Include:* Dividends and other distributions on equity; purchases, redemptions, or retirements of equity interests; payments (principal, interest, or defeasance) on subordinated indebtedness before its scheduled maturity; investments in entities or assets that are not restricted subsidiaries (including investments in unrestricted subsidiaries).
    *   *Mechanics:* Usually operates via a "builder basket" that accumulates capacity based on a percentage (often 50%) of the borrower's Consolidated Net Income (CNI) since closing (plus equity proceeds, etc.), often conditioned on no default and meeting a financial ratio. Also includes numerous specific "permitted payment" baskets (fixed amounts or grower formulas).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.1, II.D.2, referencing [6], [21]

*   **Permitted Baskets / Allowances / Carve-outs:**
    *   *Definition:* Negotiated exceptions or allowances within negative covenants that permit the borrower to undertake specific actions (e.g., incur certain amounts of debt, make certain types of liens, sell assets up to a value, make investments or restricted payments up to a limit) that would otherwise be prohibited. These can be fixed dollar amounts, amounts based on a percentage of EBITDA or Total Assets ("grower baskets"), or based on meeting a financial ratio test ("ratio debt," "ratio investments"). The aggregate capacity from these baskets can provide substantial flexibility.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.1, II.D.2 (implied throughout negative covenant discussions), referencing [6], [21]

*   **Limitation on Indebtedness (Debt Covenant):**
    *   *Definition:* A negative covenant restricting the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional financial indebtedness.
    *   *Mechanics:* The core restriction is usually supplemented by a series of "permitted debt baskets" (e.g., for existing debt, refinancing debt, capital leases, intercompany debt, general purpose basket) and often a "ratio debt" permission (allowing incurrence if a financial ratio, like FCCR or leverage, is met pro forma).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.2, referencing [21]

*   **Limitation on Liens (Negative Pledge):**
    *   *Definition:* A negative covenant prohibiting the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries from creating or permitting to exist any security interests (liens) on their assets, other than "permitted liens."
    *   *Purpose:* Protects the priority of the lenders' security package.
    *   *Mechanics:* "Permitted liens" typically include liens securing the credit agreement itself, liens existing at closing, certain statutory liens, and liens securing specific categories of permitted debt or under a general lien basket/ratio test.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.2, referencing [6]

*   **Limitation on Asset Sales (Disposals):**
    *   *Definition:* A negative covenant regulating the disposal of assets by the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries.
    *   *Mechanics:* Typically does not prohibit all sales but imposes conditions, such as requiring sales be for fair market value with a significant portion of cash consideration. Net cash proceeds (above thresholds) are usually required to be reinvested in the business (within a specified timeframe) or used to make a prepayment offer to lenders.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.2, referencing [6]

*   **Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates:**
    *   *Definition:* A negative covenant designed to prevent value leakage to related parties (e.g., private equity sponsor, other portfolio companies).
    *   *Mechanics:* Generally requires that transactions between the borrower/restricted subsidiaries and their affiliates be on terms no less favorable than those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated third party. Material affiliate transactions may require board approval. Exceptions for intercompany transactions within the restricted group, compensation, etc.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.D.2, referencing [21]
