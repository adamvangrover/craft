# Loan Facility Types Explained

Leveraged loan agreements often include several distinct types of credit facilities, each tailored to specific financing needs and investor preferences. This document details the most common ones.

*   **Term Loan A (TLA):**
    *   *Typical Investors:* Commercial banks.
    *   *Maturity:* Shorter (e.g., 3-5 years).
    *   *Amortization:* Typically features a scheduled amortization of principal over the life of the loan.
    *   *Covenants:* Often includes more stringent financial covenants, usually of the "maintenance" type (regularly tested).
    *   *Primary Use:* General corporate purposes, smaller acquisitions, refinancings.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.1, Table 1

*   **Term Loan B (TLB):**
    *   *Typical Investors:* Institutional investors (CLOs, hedge funds, credit funds).
    *   *Maturity:* Longer (e.g., 5-7 years).
    *   *Amortization:* Minimal or no amortization (e.g., 1% per annum), with the bulk of the principal repaid as a "bullet" payment at maturity.
    *   *Covenants:* Often "covenant-lite" or "covenant-loose," featuring incurrence-based financial covenants or springing maintenance covenants.
    *   *Primary Use:* Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs), large acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.1, Table 1

*   **Revolving Credit Facility (RCF):**
    *   *Typical Investors:* Commercial banks.
    *   *Maturity:* Typically 3-5 years, often coterminous with or shorter than TLBs.
    *   *Amortization:* No scheduled amortization; funds can be drawn, repaid, and re-drawn as needed up to a pre-set limit.
    *   *Covenants:* Often include "springing" financial maintenance covenants, tested only when drawings exceed a certain percentage of the total commitment.
    *   *Primary Use:* Working capital, letters of credit, general corporate purposes, funding small acquisitions.
    *   *Structure Variations:* Can be cash flow-based or asset-based (ABL).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.1, Table 1

*   **Delayed Draw Term Loans (DDTLs):**
    *   *Definition:* Committed term loan facilities that are not funded at the initial closing but can be drawn by the borrower during a specified subsequent period.
    *   *Purpose:* Often to finance identified acquisitions, capital expenditures, or other specific projects.
    *   *Ranking:* Typically rank pari passu with other existing term loan facilities in terms of security and repayment priority.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.1
