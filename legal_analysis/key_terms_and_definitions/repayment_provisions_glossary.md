# Glossary of Loan Repayment Provisions

This glossary defines key terms related to the repayment profile of leveraged loans, including maturity, amortization, and various prepayment rights and obligations. Content is primarily drawn from Section II.B.4 of the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" (Source Document).

*   **Maturity (Date):**
    *   *Definition:* The date on which the final principal payment of a loan facility is legally due and payable. Leveraged loans generally have shorter maturities compared to bonds; for instance, Term Loan Bs (TLBs) commonly have maturities in the 5 to 7-year range.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.4, referencing [4], [22]

*   **Amortization / Amortization Schedule:**
    *   *Definition:* Amortization refers to the scheduled repayment of principal in installments over the life of the loan. An amortization schedule details the allocation of each periodic payment between principal and interest.
    *   *Term Loan A (TLA):* Typically features a full amortization schedule, meaning the principal is repaid in regular installments over the loan term. (Referencing [22])
    *   *Term Loan B (TLB):* Characterized by nominal amortization (e.g., 1% per annum, often paid quarterly) or, increasingly, no amortization, with the entire principal amount due as a single "bullet" repayment at maturity. (Referencing [4])
    *   *Loan Term vs. Amortization Period:* It's important to distinguish between the loan term (legal due date) and the amortization period (timeframe for payment calculations); a mismatch can result in a significant balloon payment. (Referencing [41])
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.4

*   **Voluntary Prepayment:**
    *   *Definition:* The borrower's right to prepay the loan, in whole or in part, at its option before the scheduled maturity date.
    *   *Penalties/Call Protection:* While borrowers in leveraged loans generally have this right, TLBs often include "soft call" provisions.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.4, referencing [4]

*   **Call Protection / Soft Call Provision:**
    *   *Definition:* A provision, increasingly common in the TLB market, that imposes a prepayment premium (e.g., 1-2% of the prepaid amount) if the loan is voluntarily prepaid or refinanced, particularly with lower-yielding debt, within a relatively short period after the closing date (typically 6 to 12 months, sometimes longer).
    *   *Purpose:* To protect the institutional lenders' expected yield against opportunistic refinancing by the borrower in a declining interest rate environment or due to improved credit quality.
    *   *Distinction:* "Soft call" is a weaker form of call protection than "hard call" (a non-callable period for several years) or "make-whole" provisions (requiring payment of lost future interest) often found in high-yield bonds.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.4, referencing [4], [22]

*   **Mandatory Prepayment (MPP):**
    *   *Definition:* Contractual requirements for the borrower to make prepayments of the loan from certain specified cash inflows or upon the occurrence of specific events. The aim is to accelerate deleveraging when the borrower experiences a cash windfall or disposes of assets. LMA precedents traditionally include these.
    *   *Common Mandatory Prepayment Triggers:*
        *   **Excess Cash Flow (ECF) Sweep:** A percentage (e.g., 50-75%, sometimes stepping down with lower leverage) of the borrower's ECF must be used to prepay the loan annually or semi-annually. ECF is a defined term, typically representing cash flow after operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and scheduled debt service. Subject to negotiation regarding de minimis thresholds, permitted deductions (e.g., for voluntary prepayments, capex), and carry-forward amounts. (Referencing [6])
        *   **Asset Disposals & Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds:** Net cash proceeds from the sale of assets or the receipt of insurance or condemnation payments (above certain thresholds) are typically required to be applied to prepay the loan. However, these are often subject to significant **"reinvestment rights"** (see below). (Referencing [6])
        *   **Debt or Equity Issuances (including IPOs):** Proceeds from the issuance of new debt (other than certain permitted debt) or equity (including an Initial Public Offering - IPO) may trigger a mandatory prepayment. These provisions are often subject to leverage-based step-downs (where the prepayment requirement reduces or falls away if leverage is below a certain level) or allow proceeds to be used for other permitted purposes. (Referencing [6])
        *   **Change of Control (CoC):** Traditionally, a CoC of the borrower constituted an Event of Default and/or triggered an immediate mandatory prepayment of the entire loan. The market has seen a shift towards more flexible CoC provisions, including:
            *   **Lender Put Rights:** Giving each lender the option to demand prepayment (sometimes at a premium), similar to bondholder rights.
            *   **Portability:** Allowing the CoC mandatory prepayment to be waived if certain conditions are met (e.g., borrower maintaining specified leverage ratios or credit ratings post-acquisition). This is a significant borrower-friendly development. (Referencing [6], [38])
    *   *Negotiation Focus:* The scope of exceptions, thresholds, reinvestment rights, and definitions of events like CoC are critical negotiation areas.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.4, referencing [6], [38]

*   **Reinvestment Rights (in context of Asset Sale/Insurance Proceeds):**
    *   *Definition:* Provisions allowing the borrower to use net cash proceeds from asset sales or insurance/condemnation events to acquire replacement assets, make capital expenditures, or otherwise reinvest in the business (potentially including acquisitions or even dividends subject to conditions) within a specified timeframe (e.g., 12-18 months), instead of being required to make an immediate mandatory prepayment. The scope of permitted reinvestment has broadened in borrower-friendly markets.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.4, referencing [6]

*   **Prepayment Waterfall (Allocation of Prepayments):**
    *   *Definition:* In transactions involving multiple tranches of debt (e.g., first lien and second lien loans, or pari passu term loans and notes), the credit agreement or intercreditor agreement will specify a "prepayment waterfall." This dictates how mandatory prepayment proceeds (and sometimes voluntary prepayments) are allocated among the different classes of debt.
    *   *Purpose:* Ensures that proceeds are applied on a pro rata basis among pari passu creditors or sequentially to different priority tranches according to their agreed ranking.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.B.4, referencing [38]

*(This glossary provides a foundation. The precise terms and mechanics of repayment and prepayment provisions are heavily negotiated and detailed within each specific credit agreement.)*
