    "# Consolidated Glossary of Leveraged Lending Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook aims to provide a consolidated and potentially interactive glossary of key terms related to leveraged lending. The definitions will be drawn from the various Markdown, JSON, and HTML files within the `key_terms_and_definitions` directory, which are themselves based on the comprehensive \"Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base\" document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "*   To offer a single point of reference for many common terms.\n",
    "*   To potentially enable interactive features like searching, filtering by category (e.g., Covenants, LMEs, Economic Terms), or linking to more detailed explanations in other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure:\n",
    "The notebook could be structured to:\n",
    "1.  Load terms and definitions from the other structured files (e.g., `economic_and_pricing_terms.json`).\n",
    "2.  Present them in an organized manner (e.g., alphabetically, by category).\n",
    "3.  Implement search/filter functionality using Python code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(This is a conceptual placeholder. The actual implementation would involve Python code to parse the content of other files in this directory or directly embed/manage a comprehensive list of terms and definitions. For now, it serves as an idea for a more advanced tool within the knowledge base.)*"
