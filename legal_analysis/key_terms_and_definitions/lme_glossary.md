# Glossary of Liability Management Exercise (LME) Terms

This glossary defines key terms associated with Liability Management Exercises (LMEs) in leveraged finance. LMEs are transactions initiated by companies, often those backed by sophisticated private equity sponsors and facing financial challenges, to restructure their liabilities outside of formal bankruptcy proceedings. These exercises frequently involve exploiting flexibilities or perceived loopholes within existing credit agreements to alter the capital structure, often to the benefit of the company and certain participating creditors, but potentially to the detriment of others. Content is primarily drawn from Section III of the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" (Source Document).

*   **Liability Management Exercise (LME):**
    *   *Definition:* Transactions initiated by companies to address their balance sheet liabilities, driven by factors such as impending debt maturities, liquidity shortfalls, the desire to capture a discount on existing debt, or an effort to avoid a formal and costly insolvency process. The increasing prevalence is partly due to borrower-friendly terms and loose covenant packages from prior periods.
    *   *Purpose:* To restructure liabilities, improve liquidity, extend maturities, or otherwise manage financial distress outside of formal bankruptcy.
    *   *Consequences:* Can significantly alter capital structures, reorder priorities, and potentially lead to "lender-on-lender violence." May only be a temporary fix if underlying operational issues persist.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III, III.A, referencing [55], [58], [74]

*   **Drop-Down / Unrestricted Subsidiary Financing:**
    *   *Definition:* An LME technique involving the transfer of valuable assets (e.g., intellectual property, a profitable business unit, "crown jewel" assets) from the borrower or its restricted subsidiaries (which are part of the existing credit group) to an **Unrestricted Subsidiary**. This transfer often utilizes existing investment or restricted payment covenant baskets.
    *   *Mechanism:* Because unrestricted subsidiaries are outside the covenant perimeter and their assets do not form part of the existing lenders' collateral package, these transferred assets can then be used to secure new debt incurred by the unrestricted subsidiary. This new debt is often structurally senior to the claims of the existing lenders with respect to the transferred assets.
    *   *Impact:* Dilutes the collateral pool for existing lenders and can effectively "prime" them regarding the transferred assets.
    *   *Example Cases:* J.Crew (IP transfer), MyTheresa (Neiman Marcus spin-off), Envision Healthcare (AmSurg designation).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.A, III.B.1, III.B.4, III.B.6, referencing [52]

*   **Uptiering Exchange / Priming Transaction:**
    *   *Definition:* An LME where a company, typically with the consent of a **majority** (but not all) of its existing lenders, amends its credit agreement to permit the issuance of new debt that ranks senior in priority (i.e., "primes") to the existing debt with respect to collateral claims.
    *   *Mechanism:* The participating majority lenders then exchange their existing (now subordinated) debt for this new super-priority debt, often also providing new money to the company. Non-participating minority lenders are left holding debt that is effectively subordinated.
    *   *Key Exploited Provision:* Often relies on "open market purchase" exceptions to pro rata sharing provisions or other perceived loopholes in amendment clauses.
    *   *Example Case:* Serta Simmons.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.A, III.B.2, referencing [36]

*   **"Open Market Purchase" Exception:**
    *   *Definition:* A provision sometimes found in credit agreements that may exempt debt repurchases made by the borrower in the "open market" from the standard requirements for pro rata sharing of repayment/prepayment opportunities among all lenders in a class. The precise definition (or lack thereof) and interpretation of what constitutes an "open market purchase" is often a critical point of contention in LMEs.
    *   *Relevance:* Has been controversially used (or attempted to be used) by borrowers and majority lenders to justify non-pro rata debt exchanges or buybacks in uptiering LMEs, as seen in the Serta Simmons case.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.2 (Serta Simmons), referencing [81]

*   **Pro Rata Sharing:**
    *   *Definition:* A fundamental principle in syndicated lending requiring that payments, prepayments, and opportunities (such as participating in new debt issuances, exchanges, or buybacks offered by the borrower) be offered to all lenders within a facility or class on a proportional basis according to their respective shares or holdings of the debt.
    *   *Relevance:* Certain LMEs, like uptiering exchanges, often seek to circumvent these provisions, leading to disputes over whether such actions violate lenders' rights to pro rata treatment.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.2 (Serta Simmons context)

*   **Sacred Rights (or Reserved Matters):**
    *   *Definition:* Core lender protections embedded in a credit agreement that typically require unanimous lender consent (or consent of all affected lenders in a class) to amend.
    *   *Examples Often Include:* Changes to principal amount, interest rate (sometimes, or the margin), final maturity date (sometimes), the pro rata sharing of payments or proceeds of enforcement, release of all or substantially all collateral or guarantees.
    *   *Relevance:* These are critical protections against majority lender actions that could fundamentally alter a lender's core economic entitlements. LMEs often test the boundaries of what constitutes a sacred right or attempt to achieve a similar economic outcome through means not explicitly covered by sacred rights.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B.2 (Serta Simmons context), referencing [81]

*   **Blocker Provisions (LME Blockers):**
    *   *Definition:* Specific contractual provisions drafted into credit agreements designed to prevent or mitigate the risks associated with known LME strategies that could harm existing lenders. These have evolved reactively to market events.
    *   *Examples (Source Reference: Section III.B):*
        *   **J.Crew Blockers:** Restrict transfer of material IP or other "crown jewel" assets to unrestricted subsidiaries or cap investments in such entities. (Ref [36])
        *   **Serta Blockers:** Require higher consent thresholds (e.g., unanimous or all-affected) for amendments that subordinate existing lenders' claims or liens, or that alter pro rata sharing to their detriment; may also clarify the meaning of "open market purchase." (Ref [36])
        *   **Chewy/PetSmart Blockers:** Prevent automatic release of subsidiary guarantees and collateral merely because a guarantor subsidiary ceases to be "wholly-owned" as a result of internal stock transfers to affiliates; typically require such releases only for bona fide third-party sales. (Ref [55])
        *   **Envision Blockers:** Limit which specific covenant baskets (if any) can be used for investments in, or designation of, unrestricted subsidiaries, and prohibit the "stacking" or combination of multiple general-purpose baskets for such purposes. (Ref [36], [57])
        *   **Pluralsight Blockers:** Guard against material IP or other valuable asset transfers from loan parties to non-loan parties, including *restricted subsidiaries that are non-guarantors* (e.g., foreign or non-wholly owned subsidiaries within the restricted group but not providing credit support). (Ref [36], [55], [57])
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.B (general and specific cases)

*   **Lender-on-Lender Violence:**
    *   *Definition:* A colloquial term describing the adversarial nature of some LMEs where different factions of a lender group are pitted against each other. This occurs when a company and a subset of its lenders agree to a transaction that benefits them while disadvantaging other (often minority) lenders in the same credit facility or capital structure.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.A, referencing [55]

*   **Debt Buybacks / Tender Offers / Exchange Offers (as LMEs):**
    *   *Definition:* More traditional LME forms where a company offers to:
        *   **Buyback/Tender Offer:** Repurchase its existing debt from holders, typically at a discount to par value, for cash.
        *   **Exchange Offer:** Exchange existing debt instruments for new ones with different terms (e.g., extended maturities, modified interest rates (like PIK), different covenant packages, or different security status).
    *   *Contention:* While often less overtly aggressive than drop-downs or uptiering, these can still be structured in ways that are coercive (e.g., by offering better terms to early participants or threatening a worse outcome for non-participants) or that disadvantage certain groups of creditors.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section III.A, referencing [74]

*(This glossary provides a summary of key LME-related terms. The execution and impact of LMEs are highly fact-specific and depend on the precise language of the governing credit documents.)*
