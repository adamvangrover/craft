    "# Interactive Credit Agreement Navigator (Conceptual Prototype)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is a conceptual placeholder to illustrate how one might create a more interactive tool for navigating or annotating a sample credit agreement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To help users quickly find and understand key sections or defined terms within a complex legal document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Features (Conceptual):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load Sample Agreement Text:** A (heavily redacted or purely illustrative) sample credit agreement text could be loaded.\n",
    "2.  **Table of Contents Navigation:** Allow users to click on a section in a dynamically generated Table of Contents to jump to that part of the text.\n",
    "3.  **Defined Term Lookup:** Highlight or allow clicking on capitalized terms to show their definitions from a predefined glossary or by searching the document.\n",
    "4.  **Annotation Layer:** Allow users to add private notes or comments to specific clauses (for their own understanding).\n",
    "5.  **Search Functionality:** Search for keywords or phrases within the agreement.\n",
    "6.  **Link Related Clauses:** Create links between related clauses (e.g., a negative covenant and its permitted baskets, or an EoD and the related remedy section).\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer:\n",
    "**This is NOT a functional tool in its current state.** It's a conceptual idea. Building such a tool would require significant development effort, including text processing, UI elements (potentially using `ipywidgets` or HTML rendering), and careful handling of legal text.\n",
