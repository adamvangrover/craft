    <h1>Demystifying Legal Jargon in Credit Agreements & Financial Documents</h1>
    <p>Legal documents, especially credit agreements, are filled with specialized terminology and phrases that can be confusing. This page aims to explain some common legal jargon in plain English, drawing from the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" (referred to as "Source Document" hereafter) where applicable.</p>

    <h2>Common Phrases and Concepts:</h2>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Notwithstanding</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> In spite of; despite. This word signals that the provision it introduces takes precedence over another provision that might conflict with it. It carves out an exception or an overriding rule.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The Borrower shall not incur any Indebtedness; <u>notwithstanding</u> the foregoing, the Borrower may incur Permitted Indebtedness as defined in Section X." (The permission to incur Permitted Indebtedness overrides the general prohibition).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Provided that / Provided, however</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> Introduces a condition, exception, limitation, or proviso to the main statement. The main statement is true or permissible only if the condition that follows is met.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The Borrower may sell assets, <u>provided that</u> such sale is for fair market value and at least 75% of the consideration is in cash." (The sale is allowed, but only under these conditions).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">For the avoidance of doubt</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> To make something clear or explicit, even if it might seem obvious or is implied elsewhere. It's used to prevent misinterpretation or ambiguity regarding a specific point.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "This covenant applies to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries. <u>For the avoidance of doubt</u>, Unrestricted Subsidiaries are not subject to this covenant."
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Without prejudice to</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> Without harming, affecting, or diminishing a right, claim, or other matter. It means that one statement, action, or right does not negate or weaken another existing right or position.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The Agent may exercise any of its rights under this Agreement, <u>without prejudice to</u> any other rights or remedies available to it under applicable law or other finance documents."
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Mutatis Mutandis</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> (Latin) "With the necessary changes having been made" or "the necessary changes having been made." It's a way of applying a provision, definition, or set of rules from one context to another by making obvious or logical adjustments, without restating the whole text.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The obligations of the Guarantors under Article V (Representations and Warranties) shall apply <u>mutatis mutandis</u> to any Additional Guarantor acceding to this Agreement." (Meaning the R&Ws apply to the new guarantor with appropriate changes like its name, jurisdiction, etc.)
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Pari Passu</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> (Latin) "On an equal footing" or "with equal step." In finance, it means that claims (e.g., two series of notes, or lenders in the same tranche) rank equally in right of payment or security priority. No one claimant has precedence over the others in that group.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The Obligations of the Borrower under the finance documents rank at least <u>pari passu</u> with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness." (As per a typical representation, Source Document: Section II.C).
        </div>
        <div class="source-ref">Source Document: Section II.C</div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Herein / Hereof / Hereunder / Hereby</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> These words refer to the document itself in which they appear.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Herein:</strong> "in this document."</li>
                <li><strong>Hereof:</strong> "of this document." (e.g., "the terms hereof" means "the terms of this document").</li>
                <li><strong>Hereunder:</strong> "under this document." (e.g., "obligations hereunder" means "obligations arising under this document").</li>
                <li><strong>Hereby:</strong> "by means of this document." (e.g., "the parties hereby agree").</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The obligations of the Borrower <u>hereunder</u> shall be absolute and unconditional."
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Save as / Except as / Unless otherwise</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> These phrases introduce an exception or qualification to a general statement or rule.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "<u>Save as</u> expressly provided in Section 7.02 (Permitted Liens), the Borrower shall not create any Lien on its assets."
        </div>
    </div>

     <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">To the best of its knowledge (and belief), after due inquiry</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> This phrase qualifies a representation or warranty. It means the statement is true based on what the party making the statement currently knows (actual knowledge) or reasonably should know after making appropriate investigations ("due inquiry"). It limits liability if something previously unknown (despite reasonable efforts to find out) later proves the statement false. The "and belief" part can sometimes soften it further to what the party genuinely believes.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "<u>To the best of its knowledge, after due inquiry</u>, the Borrower is not aware of any pending litigation that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect." (Source Document: Section II.C - discussion of qualifications to representations).
        </div>
        <div class="source-ref">Source Document: Section II.C</div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Material Adverse Effect (MAE) / Material Adverse Change (MAC)</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> A defined term referring to a significant negative impact on the borrower's business, assets, operations, financial condition, or ability to perform its obligations under the finance documents. The precise definition is heavily negotiated and crucial.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> Often used as a condition precedent ("no MAC since last financials") or an Event of Default ("an event occurs that has a MAC"). Invoking a MAC clause is notoriously difficult. (Source Document: Section II.C, II.E).
        </div>
        <div class="source-ref">Source Document: Section II.C, II.E</div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Pro Forma Basis</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> A method of calculation that adjusts historical financial figures to reflect the assumed occurrence of a specific transaction (e.g., an acquisition, disposal, debt incurrence) as if it had happened at the beginning of the relevant testing period. Used extensively for testing incurrence covenants.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The Borrower may incur additional Indebtedness if, on a <u>pro forma basis</u> after giving effect to such Indebtedness, the Leverage Ratio is no greater than 4.00:1.00." (Source Document: Section II.D.2, II.D.3 - incurrence covenants context).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term-block">
        <div class="term-name">Shall / Will / May / Must</div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Meaning:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shall / Must:</strong> Indicates a mandatory obligation or requirement. "Shall" is traditional legal drafting for an imperative.</li>
                <li><strong>Will:</strong> Often indicates a future mandatory action or outcome, but sometimes used less strictly than "shall." Context is key.</li>
                <li><strong>May:</strong> Indicates permission or discretion; something is allowed but not required.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <em>Example:</em> "The Borrower <u>shall</u> deliver its financial statements within 90 days." (Mandatory) "The Lender <u>may</u> request additional information." (Discretionary)
        </div>
    </div>
