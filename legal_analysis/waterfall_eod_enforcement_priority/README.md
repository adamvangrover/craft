# Waterfall, Events of Default (EoD), Enforcement & Priority

This section delves into the critical mechanisms that come into play when a borrower defaults on its obligations under a leveraged loan. It covers the triggers for default, the remedies available to lenders, the process of enforcing security, and how proceeds from enforcement are distributed.

The content will be heavily based on Sections II.E (Events of Default and Lender Remedies), II.F (The Security Package), and II.G (Waterfall Provisions) of the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" document.

## Key Areas Covered:

*   **Events of Default (EoDs):**
    *   Common EoDs (Non-payment, covenant breach, misrepresentation, cross-default, insolvency, MAC, Change of Control etc.).
    *   Cure periods and their implications.
    *   The distinction between Default and Event of Default.
*   **Lender Remedies:**
    *   Acceleration of debt.
    *   Cancellation of commitments.
    *   Charging default interest.
    *   Right of set-off.
    *   The decision-making process for exercising remedies (role of Agent and instructing lenders).
*   **Security Enforcement:**
    *   The role of the Security Agent.
    *   Process of taking control of and realizing collateral.
    *   Considerations in different jurisdictions.
*   **Priority of Claims & Waterfall Provisions:**
    *   How proceeds from the enforcement of security are distributed among different stakeholders.
    *   Typical order: enforcement costs, super senior claims, senior secured claims, second lien claims, junior secured, unsecured, equity.
    *   The crucial role of Intercreditor Agreements in defining this priority.
    *   Concepts of lien subordination vs. payment subordination.
    *   Pro rata sharing within creditor classes.

Understanding these concepts is vital for assessing downside risk and potential recovery rates in leveraged loan investments.
