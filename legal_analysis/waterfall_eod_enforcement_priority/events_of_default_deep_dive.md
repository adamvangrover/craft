# Events of Default (EoDs): A Deep Dive

An Event of Default (EoD) is a contractually defined circumstance that signifies a serious breach of the loan agreement or a material adverse development in the borrower's condition. The occurrence and continuation of an EoD typically gives lenders the right to exercise significant remedies.

*(This document will be developed based on Section II.E of the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" document.)*

## I. What Constitutes an Event of Default?

Credit agreements will list specific events that qualify as EoDs. Common examples include:

1.  **Non-Payment:**
    *   Failure to pay principal when due (rarely any grace period).
    *   Failure to pay interest or fees when due (often a short grace period, e.g., 3-5 business days).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

2.  **Breach of Financial Covenants:**
    *   Failure to meet specified financial ratio tests (e.g., Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio) as of a testing date.
    *   For maintenance covenants, this is often an immediate EoD or has a very limited cure period (if any, sometimes tied to equity cure rights).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

3.  **Breach of Other Covenants (Affirmative or Negative):**
    *   Violation of other obligations, such as failure to provide information, comply with laws, or adhere to negative pledge or debt limitations.
    *   Often subject to a cure period (e.g., 15-30 days) if the breach is deemed "capable of remedy." The definition of "capable of remedy" can be important.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

4.  **Misrepresentation:**
    *   Any representation or warranty made by the borrower (or other obligors) in the finance documents proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed repeated.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

5.  **Cross-Default / Cross-Acceleration:**
    *   **Cross-Default:** The borrower or a material subsidiary defaults on other material financial indebtedness.
    *   **Cross-Acceleration:** Other material financial indebtedness of the borrower or a material subsidiary is accelerated by its creditors.
    *   These provisions link the loan to the borrower's broader financial health.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

6.  **Insolvency Events:**
    *   The borrower or a material subsidiary becomes insolvent (balance sheet or cash-flow insolvent).
    *   Admits inability to pay debts as they fall due.
    *   Commences voluntary bankruptcy, administration, liquidation, or similar insolvency proceedings.
    *   Has such proceedings involuntarily instituted against it (and not dismissed within a specified period, e.g., 30-60 days).
    *   Appointment of a receiver, administrator, liquidator, or trustee over substantial assets.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

7.  **Invalidity of Loan Documents / Security:**
    *   Any material provision of a loan document (credit agreement, security document, guarantee) ceases to be legal, valid, binding, or enforceable.
    *   Any security interest created under the security documents ceases to be perfected or loses its intended priority.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

8.  **Unlawfulness:**
    *   It becomes unlawful for an obligor to perform its obligations under the finance documents.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

9.  **Material Judgments:**
    *   A final judgment or order for the payment of money exceeding a certain threshold is rendered against an obligor and is not discharged, stayed, or bonded within a specified period (e.g., 30-60 days).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

10. **Cessation of Business:**
    *   The borrower or a material part of the group suspends or ceases to carry on all or a substantial part of its business.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

11. **Material Adverse Change (MAC) / Material Adverse Effect (MAE):**
    *   An event or circumstance occurs that has or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the borrower's business, assets, operations, financial condition, or ability to perform its obligations under the finance documents.
    *   While standard, this is a highly subjective EoD and often difficult for lenders to invoke successfully due to litigation risk. Its primary utility may be as a deterrent or leverage point.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

12. **Change of Control:**
    *   A change in the ownership or control of the borrower, as defined in the agreement.
    *   Unless the facility includes "portability" provisions allowing the debt to remain in place under new ownership (subject to conditions), or lenders have a put right instead of an EoD.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E, II.B.4

13. **Audit Qualification:**
    *   The borrower's auditors qualify their audit report or include a "going concern" emphasis of matter or qualification (unless related to an upcoming maturity of the loan itself which is planned to be refinanced).
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

14. **Expropriation/Nationalization:**
    *   Substantial assets of the borrower group are condemned, seized, or nationalized.
    *   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

## II. Default vs. Event of Default

*   **Default:** Often defined as an event which, with the giving of notice, lapse of time, or fulfillment of any other condition, would become an Event of Default. It's an incipient EoD.
*   **Event of Default:** The crystallized breach or event that allows lenders to exercise their remedies.

## III. Cure Periods (Grace Periods)

*   Negotiated periods that allow the borrower to remedy certain specified defaults before they become full-fledged Events of Default.
*   More common for non-financial covenant breaches or minor administrative breaches.
*   Rare for payment defaults (especially principal) or breaches of financial covenants (though equity cure rights can function as a specific type of cure for financial covenants).
*   The length and applicability of cure periods are key negotiation points.
*   *Source Reference:* Section II.E

## IV. "Defaulting Lender" Provisions (LMA Context)

*   These provisions address a lender within the syndicate failing to meet its funding obligations.
*   They aim to maintain operational integrity by allowing replacement of the Defaulting Lender, disenfranchising it from certain votes, and potentially requiring cash cover for letters of credit.
