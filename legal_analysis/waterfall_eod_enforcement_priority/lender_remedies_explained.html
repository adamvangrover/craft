    <h1>Lender Remedies Upon an Event of Default (EoD)</h1>
    <p>Once an Event of Default (EoD) has occurred under a credit agreement and is continuing (i.e., it has not been waived or remedied within any applicable cure period), lenders gain the right to exercise various remedies. These remedies are typically exercised by the Facility Agent acting on the instructions of the "Majority Lenders" (or "Required Lenders" or other defined instructing group). The primary goal of these remedies is to protect the lenders' interests, mitigate further losses, and maximize potential recovery of the outstanding amounts.</p>

    <div class="remedy">
        <div class="remedy-name">1. Acceleration of the Loan</div>
        <div class="description">
            This is often the most significant and immediate remedy. Lenders can declare all outstanding principal amounts, together with accrued interest, fees, and any other sums owing under the finance documents, immediately due and payable. The entire debt becomes payable on demand, irrespective of the original maturity dates.
        </div>
        <div class="considerations">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once accelerated, the borrower is obligated to repay the entire outstanding debt.</li>
                <li>This action frequently acts as a catalyst, often precipitating a formal restructuring process (out-of-court or in-court) or an insolvency filing if the borrower cannot meet the immediate demand for full repayment.</li>
                <li>Acceleration can trigger cross-default provisions in the borrower's other financing arrangements.</li>
            </ul>

    <div class="remedy">
        <div class="remedy-name">2. Cancellation of Commitments</div>
        <div class="description">
            Lenders can cancel any undrawn commitments under the credit facilities. This means the borrower loses the right to make further drawdowns under any revolving credit facility (RCF), delayed draw term loan (DDTL), or any other committed facility.
        </div>
        <div class="considerations">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This can severely impact the borrower's liquidity and its ability to fund ongoing operations, working capital needs, or planned expenditures.</li>
                <li>It effectively cuts off access to further credit under that specific agreement.</li>

    <div class="remedy">
        <div class="remedy-name">3. Enforcement of Security</div>
        <div class="description">
            If the loan is secured (as is typical for leveraged loans), lenders can instruct the Security Agent (or Security Trustee) to take steps to enforce the security package. This involves realizing the value of the collateralized assets.
        </div>
        <div class="considerations">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Methods of enforcement vary by jurisdiction and asset type (e.g., appointing a receiver or administrator, taking possession of assets, selling assets through public auction or private sale, exercising rights over pledged shares or bank accounts).</li>
                <li>The Intercreditor Agreement (if one exists due to multiple classes of secured debt) will govern the rights of different creditor classes to control the enforcement process and share in the proceeds.</li>
                <li>Proceeds from the sale of collateral are distributed according to the contractually agreed waterfall (see Section II.G of Source Document).</li>

    <div class="remedy">
        <div class="remedy-name">4. Charging Default Interest</div>
        <div class="description">
            The credit agreement usually allows lenders to charge a higher rate of interest (default interest) on any overdue amounts. Some agreements may also allow default interest to be charged on the entire outstanding principal balance following acceleration. This default interest is typically a specified percentage (e.g., 1-3% per annum) above the otherwise applicable interest rate (margin + benchmark).
        </div>
        <div class="considerations">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Increases the cost of default for the borrower.</li>
                <li>Compensates lenders for the increased risk, administrative burden, and potential costs associated with managing a defaulted loan.</li>

    <div class="remedy">
        <div class="remedy-name">5. Set-Off (or Offset)</div>
        <div class="description">
            Lenders that are deposit-taking institutions may have a contractual (and sometimes statutory) right to apply any credit balances held by them for the account of the borrower (e.g., funds in bank accounts maintained with that lender) against the outstanding debt owed by the borrower under the loan agreement.
        </div>
        <div class="considerations">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The extent and application of set-off rights can be subject to legal limitations (e.g., in insolvency) and the specific terms of the credit agreement.</li>
                <li>It is a self-help remedy that can provide a quick source of partial recovery for a lender holding such deposits.</li>

    <div class="remedy">
        <div class="remedy-name">6. Legal Action / Initiation of Insolvency Proceedings</div>
        <div class="description">
            Lenders can initiate legal proceedings against the borrower and any guarantors to recover the debt. This can include suing for payment of the outstanding amounts or, in certain circumstances, petitioning for the borrower's bankruptcy, liquidation, or administration (or equivalent insolvency proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction).
        </div>
        <div class="considerations">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is often a more formal and potentially lengthy and costly step.</li>
                <li>The decision to initiate insolvency proceedings is significant and involves consideration of various strategic factors and potential outcomes.</li>

    <h2>Important Notes on Exercising Remedies (Source Document: Section II.E, [51]):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decision Making & Agent Role:</strong> The decision to exercise remedies is typically made by a specified majority of lenders (e.g., "Required Lenders" or "Majority Lenders" as defined in the agreement), whose instructions are then carried out by the Facility Agent (for general remedies) or Security Agent (for security enforcement).</li>
        <li><strong>Alternatives to Immediate Enforcement:</strong> Lenders do not always immediately resort to the most aggressive enforcement actions. They may, often after an assessment of the borrower's situation and prospects, choose to:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Waive</strong> the default: Formally agree to overlook the specific breach, often in exchange for concessions such as a fee, an increased margin, tighter covenant terms, additional security, or an equity injection from sponsors.</li>
                <li>Enter into a <strong>Forbearance Agreement:</strong> Contractually agree not to exercise specified remedies for a defined period, giving the borrower time to address the underlying issues, develop a turnaround plan, or negotiate a more comprehensive restructuring. This is often subject to the borrower meeting certain conditions during the forbearance period. (See Section IV.A of Source Document).</li>
                <li>Agree to an <strong>Amendment</strong> of the credit agreement: Modify the terms of the agreement to address the cause of default or to adjust covenants to more achievable levels if the business circumstances have fundamentally changed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Intercreditor Agreement Impact:</strong> If there are multiple layers of debt (e.g., senior and junior secured debt, or secured and unsecured debt), the Intercreditor Agreement will heavily influence which creditor group controls enforcement actions against shared collateral and how any proceeds are distributed. Junior creditors may be subject to standstills imposed by senior creditors. (See Section II.F of Source Document).</li>
    </ul>
