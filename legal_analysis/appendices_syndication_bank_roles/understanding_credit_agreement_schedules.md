# Understanding Schedules (Appendices) in Credit Agreements

Credit agreements, particularly comprehensive ones like the LMA Leveraged Facilities Agreement, make extensive use of schedules (often referred to as appendices in other contexts). These schedules form an integral part of the agreement and contain detailed information that is too lengthy or specific for the main body of the text.

*(This document will be developed by referencing common LMA schedule types mentioned or implied in the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" document, e.g., in Section II.C - Repeating Representations being true on dates of utilisation requests, which are often forms in schedules, and general LMA structure as per Section II.A and "Key Sections in LMA Agreements" in `how_to_read_legal_documents`.)*

## I. Purpose of Schedules

*   **Detail and Specificity:** Provide granular details that would clutter the main clauses (e.g., lists of names, addresses, specific amounts, forms of documents).
*   **Organization:** Keep the main body of the agreement focused on operative provisions, while annexing supporting data.
*   **Ease of Amendment (for certain schedules):** Sometimes, schedules containing information that might change (e.g., list of lenders if transfers are frequent) can be updated administratively, though this is less common for core schedules.
*   **Standard Forms:** Provide agreed-upon templates for notices, certificates, or requests to be used during the life of the loan, ensuring consistency.

## II. Common Types of Schedules in an LMA Leveraged Facilities Agreement

While the exact list will vary per deal, common schedules include:

1.  **The Original Parties / Original Lenders and Commitments:**
    *   Lists the names, contact details, and initial commitment amounts of each original lender in the syndicate.
    *   May also list initial borrower(s) and guarantor(s) if not fully detailed in the main party clauses.

2.  **The Original Guarantors:**
    *   A list of all entities providing guarantees at the outset of the transaction.

3.  **Conditions Precedent (CPs):**
    *   A detailed list of all documents and evidence required to be delivered by the borrower and other obligors before the initial utilisation (drawdown) of the facilities, and sometimes for subsequent utilisations.
    *   This is a critical checklist for closing the transaction. Examples: corporate authorisations, constitutional documents, legal opinions, financial statements, security documents, fee payments.

4.  **Form of Utilisation Request (or Drawdown Request):**
    *   A template document that the borrower must use when requesting a loan under a facility (e.g., Term Loan drawdown, Revolving Credit Facility utilisation).
    *   Ensures all necessary information for the request is provided.

5.  **Form of Compliance Certificate:**
    *   A template certificate, usually signed by an officer of the borrower, delivered periodically (e.g., with quarterly financial statements).
    *   Confirms compliance with financial covenants (showing calculations) and states whether any Default or Event of Default has occurred.
    *   *Source Reference for content:* Section II.D.1 (Affirmative Covenants regarding provision of compliance certificates).

6.  **Form of Transfer Certificate / Assignment Agreement:**
    *   The standard LMA template document used by existing lenders to transfer their rights and obligations under the loan to new lenders in the secondary market.
    *   *Source Reference for context:* Section II.E (Defaulting Lender provisions often involve replacement via transfer).

7.  **Form of Accession Deed / Guarantor Accession Letter:**
    *   Templates used for new entities to become party to the credit agreement as additional guarantors or obligors (e.g., if required by a guarantor coverage test or after an acquisition).

8.  **Existing Indebtedness / Existing Liens:**
    *   Schedules listing specific indebtedness or security interests of the group that are permitted to remain in place after the new loan closes. Important for negative covenants.

9.  **Properties (for Real Estate Security):**
    *   If real estate forms a key part of the security, a schedule might list the addresses and details of the secured properties.

10. **Mandatory Prepayment Offer Notices / Reinvestment Notices:**
    *   Forms for the borrower to use when making a mandatory prepayment offer (e.g., from asset sale proceeds) or notifying lenders of its intention to reinvest such proceeds.

11. **Initial Financial Statements:**
    *   Sometimes the specific financial statements upon which lenders relied (e.g., last audited accounts, pro forma statements) are scheduled or clearly referenced.

12. **Transaction Structure / Group Structure Chart:**
    *   May include a diagram illustrating the group structure and key transaction steps, especially in complex acquisition financings.

## III. Legal Significance

*   Schedules are legally part of the credit agreement. Information and obligations contained within them are as binding as those in the main clauses.
*   Definitions in the main agreement apply to terms used in the schedules.
*   It's crucial to review all schedules carefully as they contain vital operational and factual details underpinning the transaction.

When reviewing a credit agreement, always ensure you have access to and have reviewed all accompanying schedules. They provide the context and specifics necessary for a full understanding of the deal.
