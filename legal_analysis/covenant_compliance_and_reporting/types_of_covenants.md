# Types of Covenants in Leveraged Lending

Covenants are contractual promises made by the borrower (and guarantors) within the credit agreement to conduct its business in a certain manner or to refrain from specific actions throughout the term of the loan. They are a primary tool for lenders to mitigate credit risk, monitor the borrower's performance, and protect their interests post-closing. A breach of a covenant typically constitutes a technical default, which, if not waived or cured (where permissible), can escalate into an Event of Default.

This document details the main categories of covenants found in leveraged loan agreements: Affirmative, Negative, and Financial, drawing from Section II.D.1 of the "Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base" (Source Document).

## 1. Affirmative (or Positive) Covenants

These stipulate actions that the borrower *must perform* or conditions it *must maintain*. Their purpose is often to ensure the borrower operates in a prudent manner, maintains its legal status and assets, and provides lenders with ongoing information.

**Common Examples (often found in LMA-based agreements - Source Document: Section II.D.1, Table 2):**

*   **Maintenance of Legal Existence and Corporate Status:** Ensuring the borrower and material subsidiaries remain validly incorporated and in good standing.
*   **Payment of Taxes and Other Obligations:** Requiring timely payment of all material taxes and other debts when due (unless contested in good faith).
*   **Compliance with Laws and Regulations:** Obligating the borrower to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and authorizations, including environmental laws, anti-corruption laws (e.g., FCPA, UK Bribery Act), sanctions laws (e.g., OFAC), and anti-money laundering regulations.
*   **Maintenance of Properties, Assets, and Insurance:** Requiring the borrower to keep its material properties and assets in good working order and repair (subject to ordinary wear and tear) and to maintain appropriate insurance coverage (e.g., against property damage, business interruption, public liability) with reputable insurers.
*   **Provision of Financial Statements and Other Information:** This is a critical affirmative covenant. It typically requires the borrower to deliver:
    *   Annual audited consolidated financial statements (usually within 90-120 days of fiscal year-end).
    *   Quarterly (or semi-annual) unaudited consolidated financial statements (usually within 45-60 days of quarter-end).
    *   **Compliance Certificates:** Delivered with financial statements, signed by an authorized officer, certifying compliance with financial covenants (showing calculations) and confirming no Default or Event of Default has occurred.
    *   Annual budgets or financial projections.
    *   Notices of Default, Material Adverse Effect, or material litigation.
    *   Other information reasonably requested by the Agent or Lenders.
*   **Permitting Inspections/Audits:** Allowing lenders or their representatives to conduct inspections of properties and books/records (subject to reasonable notice, ordinary business hours, and limitations on frequency unless a Default is continuing).
*   **Further Assurances:** A general undertaking to do such further things and execute such further documents as may be necessary to give effect to the terms of the finance documents (e.g., in relation to perfecting security).

## 2. Negative Covenants

These restrict the borrower from undertaking certain actions *without obtaining prior consent* from the lenders (or a specified majority thereof, e.g., Majority Lenders). Negative covenants are particularly crucial in leveraged loans as they aim to prevent actions that could:
*   Increase the lenders' credit risk.
*   Diminish the value of their collateral.
*   Leak value out of the restricted group of companies that support the credit.
*   Alter the fundamental nature or scope of the business.

Negative covenants are often structured with general prohibitions qualified by a series of "permitted" exceptions or "baskets" (fixed amounts, grower amounts based on EBITDA/assets, or ratio-based permissions). The negotiation of these baskets is a critical aspect of determining borrower flexibility.
**Source Document (Section II.D.1):** "The negotiation of 'permitted baskets' within these negative covenants is a critical aspect... These baskets are not merely minor exceptions; they represent carefully negotiated allowances that can provide substantial capacity... 'Grower baskets,' which expand based on metrics like EBITDA or total assets, and 'builder baskets' (particularly in RP covenants)... can create significant, and sometimes unpredictable, flexibility... necessitates a thorough legal analysis of how these baskets are defined, how they interact, and their potential to dilute the restrictive intent..."

**Common Examples (often found in LMA-based agreements - Source Document: Section II.D.1, II.D.2, Table 2):**

*   **Limitation on Indebtedness (Debt Covenant):** Restricts the incurrence of additional financial debt by the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries.
*   **Limitation on Liens (Negative Pledge):** Prohibits the creation of security interests over the borrower's assets in favor of other creditors (to protect the lenders' security priority).
*   **Limitation on Asset Sales (Disposals):** Restricts the sale, lease, transfer, or other disposal of assets, particularly material assets, outside the ordinary course of business.
*   **Limitation on Investments, Loans, and Acquisitions:** Restricts the borrower from making investments in, or loans to, third parties or other group companies (especially those outside the guarantor group), and from making acquisitions above certain thresholds or outside agreed parameters.
*   **Limitation on Restricted Payments (RP Covenant):** Controls the outflow of cash or assets from the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to equity holders (e.g., dividends, share repurchases) or to repay subordinated debt.
*   **Limitation on Mergers and Consolidations:** Prohibits mergers or consolidations unless the surviving entity assumes all obligations and certain financial tests are met.
*   **Limitation on Changes to Business:** Restricts fundamental changes to the nature of the borrower's business as conducted at the time of the loan.
*   **Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates:** Requires that any transactions with affiliated entities are conducted on arm's length terms (or fair market value) to prevent value extraction.
*   **Limitation on Amendments to Material Documents:** Restricting amendments to the borrower's constitutional documents or other material agreements (e.g., key customer/supplier contracts, subordinated debt documents) in a manner adverse to lenders.
*   **Limitation on Capital Expenditures (Capex):** Sometimes included as a negative covenant if not a financial covenant, limiting annual capex to an agreed amount.

*(Detailed explanations of key negative covenants like Debt, Liens, RPs, Asset Sales, and Affiliate Transactions are covered in `financial_covenants_deep_dive.md` or a dedicated negative covenants file, cross-referencing Section II.D.2 of the Source Document.)*

## 3. Financial Covenants

These require the borrower to maintain its financial condition and performance within certain pre-agreed, numerically-defined parameters. They are tested periodically (typically quarterly based on the delivered financial statements) or, in the case of incurrence-style covenants, upon the occurrence of specific events (like incurring debt). They serve as key early warning indicators of potential financial distress.

**Common Examples (Source Document: Section II.D.1, II.D.3, Table 2):**

*   **Leverage Ratio:** Total Debt to EBITDA (or Senior Debt to EBITDA) not to exceed a specified multiple.
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR):** EBITDA to Interest Expense (or Cash Interest Expense) to be not less than a specified multiple.
*   **Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR):** Similar to ICR but may include other fixed charges like lease payments, scheduled principal amortisation, and sometimes capital expenditures in the denominator or as a deduction from EBITDA.
*   **Cash Flow Cover Ratio:** Measures ability to service debt from operating cash flow.
*   **Capital Expenditure (Capex) Limitation:** Restricting annual (or quarterly) capital expenditures to an agreed amount (can also be an affirmative or negative covenant).
*   **Other ratios:** Depending on the industry or transaction, other ratios like Net Worth maintenance, specific liquidity ratios, or sector-specific metrics might be used.

The distinction between **Maintenance Covenants** (regularly tested, breach is an EoD) and **Incurrence Covenants** (tested only when taking specific actions) is fundamental and significantly impacts borrower flexibility and lender control. This is explored further in `financial_covenants_deep_dive.md`.
**Source Document (Section II.D.1):** "The distinction between 'maintenance' and 'incurrence' financial covenants is fundamental. Maintenance covenants require regular, periodic testing... A breach allows lenders to act even if no payment default has occurred... Incurrence covenants, by contrast, are tested only when the borrower proposes to take a specific action... This shift towards incurrence-based covenants in the leveraged loan market signifies a considerable transfer of operational freedom to borrowers..."

Understanding these three types of covenants and their specific formulations within a credit agreement is essential for assessing the constraints on a borrower and the protections afforded to lenders.
