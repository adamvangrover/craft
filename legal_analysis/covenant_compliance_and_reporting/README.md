# Covenant Compliance and Reporting

This section focuses on the critical aspects of covenant compliance and reporting in leveraged lending agreements. Understanding and monitoring covenants are essential for both borrowers to maintain access to credit and for lenders to manage risk.

## Key Areas Covered:

*   **Types of Covenants:**
    *   Affirmative Covenants: Obligations the borrower must fulfill.
    *   Negative Covenants: Actions the borrower must refrain from.
    *   Financial Covenants: Specific financial metrics the borrower must maintain (e.g., Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio). This includes understanding Maintenance vs. Incurrence covenants.
*   **EBITDA Definition and Adjustments:** The crucial role of EBITDA in financial covenants and the common "add-backs" and adjustments that are heavily negotiated.
*   **Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries:** The impact of subsidiary designation on covenant application and potential value leakage.
*   **Monitoring Compliance:** Processes and responsibilities for tracking adherence to covenant terms.
*   **Reporting Requirements:** Understanding the borrower's obligations to provide financial statements, compliance certificates, and other information to lenders.
*   **Consequences of Breach:** Events of Default, cure periods, and potential lender remedies.
*   **Equity Cures:** Mechanisms allowing equity holders to remedy certain financial covenant breaches.
