**Objective:** To understand the context of the loan and the key parties involved.

### Prompts:

- "Provide a summary of the loan's purpose (e.g., LBO, M&A, refinancing) and the key parties involved (Borrower, Sponsors, Arrangers, Agents)."
- "Describe the overall debt structure, including the types of facilities (e.g., Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Revolver), whether the debt is secured or unsecured, and the syndication strategy."

## 2. Deep Dive into Key Sections

**Objective:** To analyze the critical sections of the credit agreement and understand their implications.

### Prompts:

- "Analyze the 'Definitions' section of the credit agreement. Identify and explain the key negotiated definitions such as EBITDA, Indebtedness, and Change of Control."
- "Summarize the key terms of each facility, including loan amounts, currencies, interest rates, fees, and maturity dates."
- "Describe the prepayment provisions, including voluntary prepayment penalties and mandatory prepayment events (e.g., asset sales, excess cash flow)."
- "List the key Representations and Warranties made by the borrower. Which of these are 'Repeating Representations'?"
- "Analyze the covenant package, distinguishing between affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. Is the structure covenant-lite?"
- "For the negative covenants, analyze the 'permitted baskets' for indebtedness, liens, investments, and restricted payments. How much flexibility does the borrower have?"
- "For the financial covenants, identify the key ratios, their definitions, and whether they are maintenance or incurrence-based. Are there any equity cure rights?"
- "List the Events of Default (EoDs) and their grace periods. What are the lender's remedies upon an EoD?"
- "Describe the guarantee and security package. Which entities are guarantors, and what assets are pledged as collateral?"
- "Explain the process for amendments and waivers. What are the voting thresholds for key changes?"

## 3. Risk Identification and Analysis

**Objective:** To identify and assess the key legal and structural risks in the credit agreement.

### Prompts:

- "Based on the covenant analysis, what are the key risks related to potential value leakage (e.g., through dividends, investments in unrestricted subsidiaries)?"
- "Analyze the potential for 'Lender-on-Lender violence' or LME (Liability Management Exercise). How do the covenants and amendment provisions permit or restrict such actions?"
- "Assess the strength of the collateral package. Are there any significant assets excluded? How easily can collateral be released?"
- "What are the key risks in a downturn scenario? How do the covenants and EoDs protect the lenders?"
- "Identify any unusual or off-market terms in the credit agreement and explain their potential implications."
