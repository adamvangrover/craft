# Prompt Engine Library

This directory contains a library of prompts for various financial analysis tasks. The prompts are designed to be used with large language models (LLMs) to assist financial analysts in their day-to-day work.

## Structure

The library is organized into the following categories:

- `credit_analysis`: Prompts for credit analysis tasks, such as due diligence and writing credit memorandums.
- `financial_modeling`: Prompts for financial modeling tasks, such as building 3-statement models and reviewing models.
- `legal`: Prompts for legal analysis tasks, such as analyzing credit agreements.

Each category directory contains two types of files for each workflow:

- `*.md`: A human-readable markdown file that provides an overview of the prompts for a specific workflow.
- `*.json`: A machine-readable JSON file that contains the prompts in a structured format.

## How to Use

The prompts in this library can be used in a variety of ways:

- **As a learning tool:** The prompts can be used to learn about the key steps and considerations in various financial analysis tasks.
- **As a checklist:** The prompts can be used as a checklist to ensure that all important aspects of a task have been covered.
- **As input for LLMs:** The prompts can be used as input for large language models to generate analysis, summaries, and other content.

The JSON files are designed to be easily parsed by other applications. Each prompt in the JSON file has a unique ID, a category, an objective, and the prompt text.
