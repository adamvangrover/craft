2.  **Learn to Model:** Move on to the **[Financial Modeling Hub](./Financial_Modeling/index.html)**. Work through the *Best Practices* and *Templates* to understand how financial statements are projected.
3.  **Follow a Learning Path:** For a guided experience, begin the **[Credit Analyst Foundational Path](./Learning_Paths/Credit_Analyst_Foundational_Path.md)**. This path will walk you through the essential skills for a career in credit.
4.  **Explore the Lingo:** Use the **[Market Analysis Quick Start](./Market_Analysis_Quick_Start/index.html)** guide to get up to speed on common market terms and concepts.

### If you are a Current Professional looking to upskill...

You likely need specific, practical information.

1.  **Dive into Industry Primers:** If you need to get up to speed on a specific sector for a new deal or client, head to the **[Industry Primers Hub](./primers/index.html)**.
2.  **Refine Your Process:** Use the **[Toolkits & Checklists](./Toolkits_and_Checklists/index.html)** for practical job aids like the *Financial Model Review Checklist* or the *Due Diligence Checklist*.
3.  **Explore Advanced Topics:** Deepen your expertise by exploring sections like **[Legal Analysis](./legal_analysis/index.html)** for understanding credit agreements, or **[Fintech](./Fintech/index.html)** to stay current on market trends.

### If you are an AI Agent or Developer...

You are here to understand the structure and contribute.

1.  **Read the `AGENTS.MD` files:** Start with the root **[AGENTS.MD](./AGENTS.MD)** to understand the overall architecture and guiding principles. Then, review the `AGENTS.MD` file within the specific directory you are working in.
2.  **Understand the Navigation:** The global navigation is driven by **[js/nav_data.js](./js/nav_data.js)**. This is the primary file to modify when adding or changing top-level navigation.
3.  **Follow Existing Patterns:** When adding new content, follow the established patterns. For example, creating sectional hubs (like in `/primers` or `/Accounting`) with individual HTML wrappers for markdown content is the preferred approach.
4.  **Use the `global_markdown_viewer.html` Sparingly:** This viewer is a fallback. For core content, creating a styled HTML wrapper provides a better and more robust user experience.

We hope this guide helps you make the most of the Financial Learning Hub!
