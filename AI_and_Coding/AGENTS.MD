# AGENTS.MD - AI & Coding Section

## 1. Purpose

This section is dedicated to exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, coding, and finance. It will house resources for using AI tools, learning relevant coding skills (like Python for data analysis), and understanding the technologies that are transforming the financial industry.

## 2. Structure

*   `/AI_and_Coding/`: Main hub page (`index.html`) and this `AGENTS.MD`.
*   `/AI_and_Coding/Prompt_Libraries/`: A collection of prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored for financial analysis tasks.
*   `/AI_and_Coding/Agent_Libraries/`: Resources and information about AI agents that can automate financial analysis tasks.
*   `/AI_and_Coding/Python_for_Finance/`: (Future section) Tutorials and guides for using Python in financial analysis.

## 3. Content Guidelines

*   **Practicality:** Content should be practical and applicable to the work of a financial analyst.
*   **Clarity:** Explain technical concepts clearly and concisely, avoiding jargon where possible.
*   **Reproducibility:** For coding examples, ensure that the code is well-commented and can be easily reproduced.
*   **Vendor-Neutrality:** When discussing AI tools, aim to be vendor-neutral where possible, focusing on the underlying concepts and capabilities.

## 4. Future Additions

*   Tutorials on using popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for financial analysis.
*   Case studies on how AI is being used in the real world to solve financial problems.
*   Guides on how to use APIs to access financial data.
*   An introduction to machine learning concepts relevant to finance.
