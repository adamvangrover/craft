# Module 2: Mastering Prompt Engineering

Welcome to Module 2. Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions to guide Generative AI models. Mastering this skill is the single most important factor in unlocking the full potential of AI for credit analysis.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the foundational principles of clear and specific prompting.
- Learn to structure prompts with context, roles, and desired formats.
- Apply a practical toolkit of prompt templates to common credit analysis tasks.
- Master advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for complex scenarios.

## Module Content

This module is broken down into two key guides.

1.  **[Prompt Engineering: Foundations and Toolkit](./01_Foundations_and_Toolkit.md)**
    - This guide covers the essential principles of effective prompting and provides a "before and after" toolkit of templates for tasks like financial summarization, variance analysis, and stress testing.

2.  **[Advanced Prompting Techniques for Complex Scenarios](./02_Advanced_Prompting_Techniques.md)**
    - This guide explores advanced methods required for more complex analytical tasks. It covers Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Few-Shot Prompting, and more, with clear examples of when and how to use each technique.
