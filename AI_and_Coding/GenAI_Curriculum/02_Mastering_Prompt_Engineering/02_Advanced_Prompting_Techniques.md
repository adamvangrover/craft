# Advanced Prompting Techniques for Complex Scenarios

For more complex financial analysis, basic prompts are insufficient. Analysts must leverage advanced techniques to guide the AI's reasoning process, ensure accuracy, and maintain data security. These methods are essential for moving from simple automation to sophisticated analytical partnership.

## Key Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
This technique instructs the AI to "think step-by-step," verbalizing its reasoning process before delivering a final answer. This mimics human logical deduction and significantly improves the accuracy of multi-step calculations by catching errors along the way.

- **Ideal Use Case**: Multi-step calculations, financial modeling, complex ratio analysis, ensuring logical consistency.
- **Example Prompt**: *"Calculate the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) for Company ABC. First, calculate EBITDA from the income statement. Second, calculate total debt service from the balance sheet and debt schedule. Finally, divide EBITDA by total debt service. Show each step."*

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG is arguably the most critical technique for financial applications. It addresses the dual problems of model "hallucinations" and data privacy. RAG connects the LLM to an external, curated knowledge baseâ€”such as a bank's secure repository of internal financial reports. The system first retrieves relevant information from this trusted database and then provides it to the LLM as context, forcing the AI to generate its answer based only on the verified, private data.

- **Ideal Use Case**: Querying secure internal documents, ensuring data privacy, preventing hallucinations by grounding answers in verified facts, analyzing proprietary research.
- **Example Prompt**: *"Using the attached internal credit policy document and the Q3 financial statements for Company XYZ, assess whether the company is in compliance with all financial covenants. Cite the specific policy section and financial data for each conclusion."*

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting
This method involves including a few examples (shots) of the desired input and output format directly within the prompt. By showing the AI exactly what a correct response looks like, you can guide it to produce outputs in a consistent and specific format.

- **Ideal Use Case**: Enforcing a consistent output format (e.g., JSON, specific table structure), standardizing data extraction across multiple documents.
- **Example Prompt**: *'Extract the following risk factors from the text. Example 1: Input: "The company faces currency fluctuation risk." Output: {"Risk_Type": "Market", "Factor": "Currency Fluctuation"}. Example 2: Input: "Our main supplier may face bankruptcy." Output: {"Risk_Type": "Operational", "Factor": "Supplier Concentration"}. Now, process this text: [Insert new text]'*

### 4. Self-Consistency
To enhance the reliability of answers, this technique involves running the same prompt multiple times and choosing the final answer by a majority vote among the outputs. This helps filter out outlier or illogical responses.

- **Ideal Use Case**: Subjective analysis (e.g., sentiment analysis), complex reasoning tasks where a single answer may be unreliable, improving the robustness of qualitative judgments.
- **Example Prompt**: *"Analyze the attached management discussion and determine the overall sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative). Provide a one-sentence justification."* (Run this prompt 3-5 times and use the most common sentiment).

### 5. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
An advanced evolution of CoT, this technique encourages the model to explore multiple different reasoning paths simultaneously. It evaluates the intermediate steps in each "branch" and prunes ineffective paths, pursuing the most promising line of reasoning.

- **Ideal Use Case**: Complex strategic problem-solving, brainstorming solutions with trade-offs, evaluating alternative business plans or restructuring options.
- **Example Prompt**: *"Develop three distinct potential strategies for Company Z to improve its working capital position over the next six months. For each strategy, outline the pros, cons, and potential impact on liquidity ratios. Finally, recommend the most viable strategy and justify your choice."*
