# Case Study: Automating Credit Memo Generation

This case study demonstrates how Generative AI can be used to significantly accelerate the creation of a credit memorandum, a core task for any credit analyst.

## The Challenge

A senior credit analyst needs to prepare a comprehensive credit memo for a new lending request from "Global Manufacturing Inc." The analyst has access to a variety of internal and external documents:
- The company's latest annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) financial reports.
- A third-party industry analysis report.
- Internal records of past dealings with the company.
- The company's formal loan application.

Traditionally, this process would take several hours of manually reading through documents, extracting key information, and writing the narrative for each section of the credit memo.

## The AI-Powered Solution

The analyst uses a GenAI-powered platform (connected to a secure, internal data repository via RAG) to automate the initial draft.

### Step 1: Business Summary Generation
The analyst uses a prompt to generate the business description section.

**Prompt:**
```
Act as a credit analyst. Using the attached 10-K report for Global Manufacturing Inc., generate a concise "Description of Business Operations" section for a credit memo. The summary should cover the company's primary business activities, key products or services, and main geographic markets.
```
**AI Output:**
The AI processes the 10-K and produces a well-articulated summary of the company's operations, saving the analyst from having to read and synthesize the lengthy business description section of the report.

### Step 2: Risk Factor Identification
Next, the analyst moves to the risk factors section.

**Prompt:**
```
Review the "Risk Factors" section of the attached 10-K and the "Market Outlook" section of the attached industry report. Identify and summarize the top 5 key credit risks for Global Manufacturing Inc. Categorize each risk as either 'Operational', 'Market', or 'Financial'. Present the output as a bulleted list.
```
**AI Output:**
The AI synthesizes information from two different documents, identifying and categorizing the most critical risks, such as supply chain dependencies (Operational), sensitivity to commodity prices (Market), and upcoming debt maturities (Financial).

### Step 3: Financial Performance Analysis
The analyst then uses the AI to generate a narrative for the financial performance section.

**Prompt:**
```
Using the attached 10-K and 10-Q reports, generate a "Financial Performance Analysis" section. The analysis should cover:
1.  Year-over-year revenue growth trends.
2.  Key drivers of the recent changes in EBITDA margin.
3.  An overview of the company's liquidity position, referencing the current ratio and cash on hand.
Present the analysis in a narrative format, supported by key figures from the reports.
```
**AI Output:**
The AI generates a detailed narrative, complete with figures and percentages, explaining the company's recent financial performance. It correctly calculates ratios and identifies trends from the raw financial data.

## The Outcome

- **Efficiency:** The initial draft of the credit memo, which would have taken 3-4 hours to prepare manually, is generated in under 15 minutes.
- **Focus on High-Value Work:** The analyst is freed from the mechanical tasks of data extraction and summary writing. Their time is now spent on the "so what" of the analysis:
    - Critically reviewing and validating the AI's output.
    - Adding their own expert judgment and nuanced insights.
    - Evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower and structuring the loan appropriately.
    - Communicating the final recommendation to the credit committee.

This case study illustrates the power of the human-in-the-loop paradigm. The AI handles the "grunt work," while the human analyst provides the critical thinking, strategic oversight, and final decision-making, leading to a faster, more efficient, and still rigorous credit analysis process.
