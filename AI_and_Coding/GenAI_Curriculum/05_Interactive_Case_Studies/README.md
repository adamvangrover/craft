# Module 5: Interactive Case Studies & Capstone Project

Welcome to the final module of the GenAI curriculum. This is where you will apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired in the previous modules to solve practical, real-world credit analysis challenges.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply advanced prompting techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a public company.
- Synthesize information from multiple, complex documents to form a coherent credit assessment.
- Use AI as a workflow automation tool to perform an end-to-end credit assessment of a private company.
- Integrate your own critical judgment with AI-generated output to formulate a final recommendation.

## Module Content

This module contains two major projects.

1.  **[Case Study: Comprehensive Analysis of a Public Company](./01_Case_Study_Comprehensive_Company_Analysis.md)**
    - This case study challenges you to use an AI assistant to conduct a full analysis of a public company, from generating a company overview to formulating key questions for management.

2.  **[Capstone Project: End-to-End Credit Assessment](./02_Capstone_Project_End_to_End_Credit_Assessment.md)**
    - This is the final project of the curriculum. You will act as the lead analyst on a private company loan request, using AI to automate data extraction, perform deep-dive analysis, and generate a full credit memo, culminating in your own, human-driven final recommendation.

## Next Steps
Congratulations on completing the GenAI for Credit Analysts learning path! We encourage you to continue exploring the other resources in this hub and apply these skills in your daily work.
