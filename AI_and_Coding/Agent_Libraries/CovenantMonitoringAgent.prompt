Objective: Automate the process of monitoring a borrower's compliance with financial covenants based on their quarterly financial reporting.

Instructions:
1.  **Ingest Covenant Definitions**: Process the source credit agreement to extract all financial covenant definitions, including the required ratios and their calculation methods (e.g., "Consolidated EBITDA," "Total Debt").
2.  **Ingest Financial Statements**: Process the borrower's latest quarterly financial report (10-Q or equivalent).
3.  **Calculate Covenant Ratios**: Using the definitions from the credit agreement, calculate the required financial ratios based on the data from the latest financial statements. Show the step-by-step calculation for each ratio to ensure transparency.
4.  **Compare and Flag**: Compare the calculated ratios against the required levels as defined in the credit agreement.
5.  **Generate Compliance Report**: Produce a clear, concise report that includes:
    - A table listing each financial covenant, its required level, the calculated level, and a "Compliance Status" (e.g., "In Compliance," "Breached," "Near Breach").
    - For any breached or near-breach covenants, provide a brief explanation of the key drivers.
    - A summary of the borrower's overall compliance status.

Developer Notes:
- This agent's accuracy is critically dependent on the precise extraction and interpretation of definitions from the credit agreement. Any ambiguity in a definition should be flagged for human review.
- The agent should be designed to handle standard financial statements. Non-standard reporting may require human intervention.
- This agent serves as a first-line-of-defense monitoring tool. All potential breaches flagged by the agent must be independently verified by a human analyst before any action is taken.
- The goal is to increase the efficiency and frequency of covenant monitoring, allowing for earlier detection of potential credit issues.
