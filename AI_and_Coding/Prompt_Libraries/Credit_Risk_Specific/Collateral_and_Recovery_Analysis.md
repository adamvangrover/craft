# Prompt Library: Collateral and Recovery Analysis

This library provides prompts for analyzing the collateral package and estimating potential recoveries in a default scenario.

---

## 1. For the Junior Analyst

*Focus: Identifying the collateral and basic calculations.*

### Collateral Identification:
- "What specific assets have been pledged as collateral for the loan? (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment, intellectual property)."
- "Are there any assets that are specifically excluded from the collateral package?"
- "Is the collateral subject to any prior liens or claims?"

### Basic Recovery Metrics:
- "What is the net book value of the assets pledged as collateral, as shown on the latest balance sheet?"
- "Assuming a generic recovery rate of 80% on accounts receivable, 50% on inventory, and 30% on PP&E, what is the estimated value of the collateral?"

## 2. For the Senior Analyst / Portfolio Underwriter

*Focus: Evaluating the quality of the collateral and performing a recovery analysis.*

### Collateral Quality Assessment:
- "Assess the quality and liquidity of the collateral. For example, how good is the quality of the accounts receivable? Is the inventory subject to obsolescence?"
- "Are there any legal or practical impediments to foreclosing on and selling the collateral in a default scenario?"
- "Has an independent appraisal of the collateral been performed? If so, what is the appraised value?"
- "How does the value of the collateral compare to the loan amount? What is the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio?"

### Recovery Analysis:
- "Perform a detailed recovery analysis for the senior secured debt in a downside scenario. Estimate the enterprise value of the company in a restructuring, the value of the collateral, and the expected recovery rate for the senior lenders. State your key assumptions."
- "How would the recovery prospects change if the company had to be liquidated rather than restructured? What is the estimated liquidation value of the assets?"
- "Analyze the priority of claims (the 'waterfall'). In a bankruptcy, which parties would get paid before the senior lenders? (e.g., administrative claims, priority tax claims)."

## 3. For the Specialist (e.g., Appraiser, Insolvency Practitioner)

*Focus: In-depth valuation, legal perfection of security, and complex recovery scenarios.*

### Advanced Collateral Valuation:
- "Provide a detailed valuation of the company's intellectual property (e.g., patents, trademarks, brand value). What valuation methodology did you use?"
- "Analyze the potential for significant dilution of the collateral pool. Are there provisions that allow the company to dispose of collateral without lender consent?"
- "Have the security interests in the collateral been properly 'perfected' under the relevant laws? If not, what is the risk that the lenders could lose their priority claim?"

### Complex Recovery Scenarios:
- "Model the recovery outcomes under different restructuring scenarios (e.g., a debt-for-equity swap, an asset sale). What are the key variables that would determine the outcome for lenders?"
- "Analyze the impact of intercreditor agreements on the recovery prospects. Are there any subordination agreements or other arrangements that could affect the priority of payments?"
- "In a cross-border insolvency, what are the key legal challenges that could complicate the enforcement of security and the recovery process?"
