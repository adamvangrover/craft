# Prompt Library: Credit Modeling and Monitoring

This library provides prompts related to financial modeling, credit scoring, and ongoing monitoring of credit exposures.

---

## 1. For the Junior Analyst

*Focus: Populating models, running basic scenarios, and tracking information.*

### Financial Modeling:
- "Populate the attached financial model template with the historical financial data for [Company Name]."
- "Update the financial model with the latest quarterly results and check for any formula errors."
- "Run a simple sensitivity analysis in the model. What is the impact on Net Income if revenue is 5% lower than the base case?"

### Monitoring & Reporting:
- "Create a tracking sheet for the financial covenants for [Company Name]. It should include the covenant definition, the required level, and the actual reported level for the last four quarters."
- "Summarize the key highlights from [Company Name]'s latest quarterly earnings release."
- "Check for any recent news or press releases related to [Company Name] and its key competitors."

## 2. For the Senior Analyst / Portfolio Underwriter

*Focus: Building and evaluating models, designing stress tests, and identifying early warning signs.*

### Financial Modeling & Forecasting:
- "Build a three-statement financial model for [Company Name] for the next five years. Clearly state your key assumptions for revenue growth, margins, and capital expenditures."
- "Critically evaluate the management's financial forecast. Are the assumptions consistent with the company's strategy and the industry outlook? Develop your own 'base case' forecast."
- "What is the company's projected debt capacity? At what level of leverage would the credit metrics become unsustainable?"

### Stress Testing & Early Warning:
- "Design and run a severe but plausible downside scenario stress test for [Company Name]. The scenario should incorporate both macroeconomic and company-specific factors. Will the company breach its covenants in this scenario?"
- "Based on your analysis, what are the top five early warning indicators that you should monitor for [Company Name]? (e.g., declining margins, rising inventory, covenant cushion erosion)."
- "The company has announced a major acquisition. Model the pro-forma impact on its financial statements and credit metrics."

## 3. For the Specialist (e.g., Quantitative Analyst, Head of Portfolio Monitoring)

*Focus: Developing advanced models, automating monitoring, and portfolio-level analysis.*

### Advanced Credit Modeling:
- "Develop a statistical model to predict the probability of default (PD) for [Company Name] over the next 12 months. What are the key predictive variables in your model?"
- "Build a model to estimate the Loss Given Default (LGD) for the senior secured debt of [Company Name]. Your model should incorporate collateral values, seniority, and potential legal costs."
- "Use Monte Carlo simulation to model the future distribution of [Company Name]'s key credit ratios. What is the probability of a covenant breach?"

### Automated Monitoring & Portfolio Analysis:
- "Design an automated system to scrape public data sources (e.g., news articles, regulatory filings, social media) for potential credit-negative events related to the companies in our portfolio."
- "Analyze the correlations between the credit risks of the different companies in our loan portfolio. What is our portfolio's overall concentration risk to the [Industry Name] industry or to [Macroeconomic Factor]?"
- "Develop a portfolio-level stress test. Model the impact of a severe recession on the expected losses of our entire loan portfolio."
