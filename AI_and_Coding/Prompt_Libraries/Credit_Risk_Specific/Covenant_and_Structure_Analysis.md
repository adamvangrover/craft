# Prompt Library: Covenant and Structure Analysis

This library provides prompts for analyzing loan covenants, debt structure, and the overall terms of a credit agreement.

---

## 1. For the Junior Analyst

*Focus: Extracting key terms and identifying standard provisions.*

### Covenant Identification:
- "Extract all financial covenants from the attached credit agreement and list them in a table. Include the definition and the required compliance level for each."
- "List the negative covenants in the 'Negative Covenants' section. Which activities are restricted (e.g., asset sales, mergers, incurring more debt)?"
- "What are the 'Events of Default' listed in the credit agreement?"
- "Does the credit agreement contain an equity cure provision? If so, summarize its key features."

### Structure Identification:
- "Describe the debt structure of the proposed transaction. What are the different tranches of debt (e.g., Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B)? What are their amounts and maturities?"
- "Who is the borrower? Are there any guarantors? If so, who are they?"

## 2. For the Senior Analyst / Portfolio Underwriter

*Focus: Assessing the strength of the covenant package and appropriateness of the structure.*

### Covenant Analysis:
- "Analyze the tightness of the financial covenants. Calculate the amount of headroom or 'cushion' the company has under each covenant based on the latest financial projections."
- "Is the covenant package appropriate for the risk profile of the borrower and the nature of the industry? Are there any loopholes or weaknesses in the definitions (e.g., an overly broad definition of EBITDA)?"
- "Evaluate the negative covenants. Do they provide adequate protection against credit-harming actions by the borrower, such as value leakage to junior creditors or equity holders?"
- "Compare the proposed covenant package to recent deals for similarly rated companies in the same industry. Is it 'covenant-lite' or does it have a strong set of protections?"

### Structural Analysis:
- "Assess the overall structural risk of the transaction. Are there any features that could disadvantage senior lenders (e.g., a large amount of junior debt, permissive 'incremental facility' language)?"
- "Evaluate the guarantor package. Is it comprehensive? Are there any significant subsidiaries that are not providing a guarantee ('non-guarantor subsidiaries')?"
- "What is the rationale for the proposed debt structure? Does it align with the company's funding needs and repayment capacity?"

## 3. For the Specialist (e.g., Legal Counsel, Restructuring Advisor)

*Focus: Deep legal interpretation, identifying loopholes, and analyzing creditor rights.*

### Advanced Covenant & Legal Analysis:
- "Review the definition of 'EBITDA' and 'Net Debt' in the credit agreement. Identify any aggressive adjustments or add-backs that could distort the calculation of the key financial ratios."
- "Analyze the 'Permitted Investments' and 'Restricted Payments' sections. Could the borrower use these provisions to move assets outside the reach of creditors (e.g., to unrestricted subsidiaries)?"
- "What are the specific remedies available to lenders upon an Event of Default? How quickly can lenders accelerate the loan and enforce on collateral?"
- "From a legal perspective, are there any ambiguities in the covenant language that could be subject to dispute in the future?"

### Distressed & Restructuring Scenarios:
- "In a downside scenario, how much additional debt could the company incur under the 'incurrence-based' negative covenants? Could this dilute the claims of existing lenders?"
- "Analyze the potential for 'lender-on-lender violence'. Are there provisions in the credit agreement that could allow a majority group of lenders to subordinate the claims of a minority group in a restructuring?"
