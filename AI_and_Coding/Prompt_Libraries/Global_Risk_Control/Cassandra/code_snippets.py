    The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today issued a final rule that modifies the framework for calculating the capital surcharge for global systemically important bank holding companies (G-SIBs).
    The Board believes that a higher G-SIB surcharge is necessary to address the heightened risks that these firms pose to U.S. financial stability. The final rule increases the G-SIB surcharge by an average of 50 basis points for all firms.
    Furthermore, the final rule adopts a more risk-sensitive measure of interconnectedness, which will result in a more accurate assessment of a firm's systemic footprint. The implementation timeline has been set to 18 months from the date of this final rule.
