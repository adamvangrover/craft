# AGENTS.MD - Prompt Libraries Section

## 1. Purpose

This section will contain a curated collection of prompts for use with Large Language Models (LLMs). The prompts should be designed to assist with a wide range of financial analysis tasks, from summarizing financial reports to generating investment ideas.

## 2. Structure

*   `/Prompt_Libraries/`: Main hub page (`index.html`) and this `AGENTS.MD`.
*   `/Prompt_Libraries/Company_Analysis/`: Prompts related to the analysis of individual companies.
*   `/Prompt_Libraries/Industry_Analysis/`: Prompts related to the analysis of industries.
*   `/Prompt_Libraries/Economic_Analysis/`: Prompts related to the analysis of economic data and trends.

## 3. Content Guidelines

*   **Clarity:** Prompts should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
*   **Specificity:** Prompts should be specific enough to generate useful and relevant responses from an LLM.
*   **Context:** Provide context for each prompt, explaining what it is designed to do and how to use it effectively.
*   **Examples:** Include example outputs for each prompt to demonstrate what a good response looks like.
*   **LLM-Agnostic:** Where possible, design prompts to be effective across different LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).

## 4. Future Additions

*   Prompts for specific financial modeling tasks.
*   Prompts for generating code (e.g., Python scripts for financial analysis).
*   A guide on how to write effective prompts for financial analysis.
