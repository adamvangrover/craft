# Wealth Management

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Wealth management is a relationship-driven business where trust and holistic advice are paramount. For analysts covering wealth management firms, key metrics include Assets Under Management (AUM), net flows, fee compression, and the efficiency of the advisor network. It's a stable, capital-light business, but one facing disruption from technology (robo-advisors) and regulatory changes.

## Overview

Wealth management combines financial planning, investment portfolio management, and a number of aggregated financial services for high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), small-business owners, and families.

## Key Concepts

*   **Financial Planning:** The comprehensive evaluation of an investor's current and future financial state to predict future cash flows, asset values, and withdrawal plans.
*   **Investment Management:** The professional asset management of various securities (shares, bonds, and other assets) and other securities (e.g., real estate) in order to meet specified investment goals.
*   **Estate Planning:** The process of anticipating and arranging, during a person's life, for the management and disposal of their estate during the person's life and at and after death.
