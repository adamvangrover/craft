# Behavioral Biases in Client Portfolios: Diagnosis and Correction

> **Advisor's Perspective:**
> Markets might be efficient, but clients are not. Behavioral finance is the study of why smart people make stupid money decisions. As a wealth manager, you are 50% financial analyst and 50% psychologist. Your value add is often "Behavioral Coaching"—stopping a client from making a fatal error during a panic.

## 1. Cognitive Errors vs. Emotional Biases

It is crucial to distinguish between the two because the "cure" is different.

| Type | Definition | Correction Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive Error** | A failure in reasoning or processing information. (e.g., Mental Accounting). | **Education.** Show the data. Correct the math. |
| **Emotional Bias** | Driven by feelings, intuition, or impulse. (e.g., Loss Aversion). | **Adaptation.** It is hard to change feelings. Build a portfolio that accommodates the bias (to a limit). |

## 2. Top 5 Biases in Wealth Management

### 1. Loss Aversion (Emotional)
The pain of a loss is 2x stronger than the joy of an equivalent gain.
*   **Symptom:** Client holds onto losing stocks hoping they "break even" (Get-even-itis) but sells winners too early.
*   **Correction:** Use "Goal-Based Investing". Frame the portfolio not as "beating the market" but as "funding the beach house."

### 2. Overconfidence (Emotional)
Client believes they have superior information or skill.
*   **Symptom:** Excessive trading, under-diversification (holding too much of one stock).
*   **Correction:** Show them their actual trading track record (often negative alpha). Suggest a "Core-Satellite" approach (keep 90% boring, play with 10%).

### 3. Confirmation Bias (Cognitive)
Seeking only information that supports your existing view.
*   **Symptom:** A client who loves Gold only reads "Gold Bug" newsletters and ignores inflation data.
*   **Correction:** Play Devil's Advocate. "What evidence would you need to see to change your mind?"

### 4. Home Bias (Emotional/Cognitive)
Over-investing in domestic assets because they feel "safe."
*   **Symptom:** A US investor with 100% US stocks, missing global growth.
*   **Correction:** Show a global efficient frontier. Explain that "familiarity" does not equal "safety."

### 5. Mental Accounting (Cognitive)
Treating money differently based on its source or intended use.
*   **Symptom:** Treating a tax refund as "free money" to gamble, while being frugal with salary.
*   **Correction:** Look at the "Total Portfolio." Money is fungible.

## 3. Interactive Diagnosis: Name that Bias

**Scenario:**
Client calls you: *"I heard on the news that a recession is coming. I want to sell everything and go to cash. I remember 2008 and I can't go through that again."*

**Diagnosis:**
*   **Primary Bias:** **Recency Bias** (giving too much weight to recent news/fears) and **Loss Aversion** (fear of 2008 pain).
*   **Action:** Do not bombard with charts immediately. Acknowledge the fear (Validate). Then re-anchor to the Long-Term Plan (IPS). Remind them that they have a "cash bucket" for near-term needs (Mental Accounting used for good).

## 4. Glossary of Key Terms

*   **Bounded Rationality:** The idea that individuals are limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make a decision.
*   **Heuristic:** A mental shortcut used to make decisions quickly.
*   **Framing:** The way an investment decision is presented (e.g., "90% chance of success" vs "10% chance of failure") affects the choice.
