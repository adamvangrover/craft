> **Buy-Side Perspective:** The "Great Wealth Transfer" will see trillions move from Baby Boomers to Millennials. For a Wealth Manager, this is the moment of maximum risk. 70% of heirs fire their parents' financial advisor after receiving the inheritance. Your value proposition must shift from "Investment Returns" to "Family Governance and Tax Alpha."

# Wealth Transfer Strategies & Estate Planning

## 1. The Core Objective: Preservation vs. Growth

In wealth transfer, the goal shifts. It is no longer about maximizing Sharpe Ratio; it is about minimizing the "drag" of taxes and family conflict.

*   **Generation 1 (G1):** The Wealth Creators. Focused on control and growth.
*   **Generation 2 (G2):** The Stewards. Focused on maintenance and lifestyle.
*   **Generation 3 (G3):** The Consumers. Statistically, this is where wealth often dissipates ("Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations").

## 2. Key Vehicles for Transfer

### A. Revocable Living Trust (RLT)
*   **Purpose:** Avoid probate (privacy and speed).
*   **Tax Impact:** None. Grantor pays taxes.
*   **Control:** G1 retains full control.

### B. Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)
*   **Purpose:** Liquidity to pay estate taxes.
*   **Mechanism:** The trust owns the policy, keeping the death benefit *out* of the taxable estate.
*   **Risk:** Crummey powers must be executed correctly to qualify gifts.

### C. GRAT (Grantor Retained Annuity Trust)
*   **Purpose:** Transfer appreciation tax-free.
*   **Mechanism:** G1 puts assets in, receives an annuity stream back. Any growth *above* the IRS "Hurdle Rate" (7520 rate) passes to G2 tax-free.
*   **Best For:** High-growth assets (Pre-IPO stock, volatile tech stocks) in a low-interest-rate environment.

> **Pro Tip:** Never put a low-basis asset (like stock bought at $1 that is now $100) into a vehicle that loses the "Step-Up in Basis" at death unless you have run the numbers on Estate Tax vs. Capital Gains Tax. Sometimes, dying with the asset is the most tax-efficient strategy.

## 3. The "Soft Side": Family Governance

Strategies fail not because of math, but because of trust.

*   **The Family Constitution:** A non-binding document outlining the "Why" of the wealth.
*   **The "Skin in the Game" Rule:** Many HNW families require G2 to generate their own income before accessing trust distributions.
*   **Equal vs. Equitable:** Treating all kids "Equally" (50/50 split) might not be "Equitable" if one is the CEO of the family business and the other is a passive artist.

## 4. Case Study: The Business Succession

**Scenario:** The Founder (75) owns 100% of a Manufacturing company worth $50M.
*   **Son:** COO, runs the daily operations.
*   **Daughter:** unrelated career, needs cash for a house.

**The Problem:** The business is illiquid. If the Founder dies, estate taxes (40% of amount over exemption) might force a sale.

**The Solution:**
1.  **Recapitalization:** Split stock into Voting (Class A) and Non-Voting (Class B).
2.  **Transfer:** Give Voting stock to Son (Control). Give Non-Voting stock to Daughter (Economic benefit).
3.  **Liquidity:** ILIT buys life insurance on Founder to pay the taxes, preventing a forced sale of the factory.

**Scenario:** Client holds Amazon stock bought in 1998 for $10,000. It is now worth $2,000,000.
**Option A:** Gift it to daughter now.
**Option B:** Leave it to daughter in the will.

**Question:** Which saves more tax?

**Answer:** **Option B.**
If gifted now (Option A), the daughter takes the *original basis* ($10,000). If she sells, she pays Capital Gains tax on $1.99M of gain.
If inherited (Option B), the basis "Steps Up" to the value at date of death ($2,000,000). If she sells immediately, the capital gain is $0.
