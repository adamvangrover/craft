# Estate Planning

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Estate planning is often the catalyst for intergenerational wealth transfer. For wealth management firms, the risk is that when the client dies, the heirs (children) take the money elsewhere. Firms are increasingly focusing on engaging the "Next Gen" early to retain these assets.

## 1. What is Estate Planning?

Estate planning is the process of arranging for the management and disposal of a person's estate during their life and after death. The primary goals are:
1.  Ensure assets go to the intended beneficiaries.
2.  Minimize taxes (estate, gift, inheritance).
3.  Avoid probate (the public, slow legal process of validating a will).

## 2. Key Documents

*   **Will:** A legal document that coordinates the distribution of your assets after death. It can appoint guardians for minor children.
*   **Trust:** A fiduciary arrangement where a third party (trustee) holds assets on behalf of a beneficiary. Trusts can avoid probate and provide control over *when* and *how* assets are distributed.
*   **Power of Attorney (POA):** Designates someone to make financial or legal decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated.
*   **Healthcare Proxy / Living Will:** Designates someone to make medical decisions if you cannot.

## 3. Types of Trusts

*   **Revocable Living Trust:** You retain control during your lifetime and can change it. Avoids probate, but generally does not provide tax protection or asset protection from creditors.
*   **Irrevocable Trust:** You give up control. Assets are removed from your estate, potentially lowering estate taxes and protecting assets from creditors.

## 4. Taxation

*   **Estate Tax:** A tax on your right to transfer property at your death. (Federal exemption is quite high, but some states have lower thresholds).
*   **Gift Tax:** Tax on the transfer of property by one individual to another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return.
*   **Step-Up in Basis:** A major tax benefit where the cost basis of an inherited asset (like a stock) is adjusted to its fair market value at the date of the decedent's death. This eliminates capital gains tax on appreciation that occurred during the decedent's life.

## Glossary Definitions

*   **Probate:** The legal process of proving a will is valid and administering the estate of a dead person.
*   **Grantor/Settlor:** The person who establishes a trust.
*   **Trustee:** The person or institution responsible for managing the assets in a trust.
*   **Beneficiary:** The person or entity who receives the benefits of the trust or will.
