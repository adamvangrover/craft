# Investment Management

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> While financial planning sets the goals, investment management provides the engine to reach them. The trend is shifting from "stock picking" to "asset allocation" and "factor investing." For wealth management firms, the move to fee-based (AUM %) revenue from commission-based (transactional) revenue has improved earnings quality and valuation multiples.

## 1. Asset Allocation

The single most important determinant of portfolio performance is **Asset Allocation**—the mix of stocks, bonds, cash, and alternative investments.

*   **Strategic Asset Allocation:** The long-term target mix (e.g., 60% Stocks / 40% Bonds) based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
*   **Tactical Asset Allocation:** Short-term deviations from the target to exploit market opportunities (e.g., overweighting tech stocks).

## 2. Investment Vehicles

*   **Mutual Funds:** Pooled investment vehicles managed by professionals.
*   **ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds):** Trade like stocks, typically lower cost and more tax-efficient than mutual funds.
*   **Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs):** Direct ownership of securities, allowing for customization (e.g., tax management, ESG screening).
*   **Alternative Investments:** Private equity, hedge funds, real estate, commodities. Used for diversification and potential alpha.

## 3. Active vs. Passive Management

*   **Passive (Indexing):** Trying to match the market return (beta) at the lowest possible cost. (e.g., buying an S&P 500 ETF).
*   **Active:** Trying to beat the market (alpha) through security selection or market timing. Generally higher fees.

**The Trend:** Massive flows from Active to Passive over the last decade due to cost and the difficulty of consistently beating the market.

## 4. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

The framework developed by Harry Markowitz. It posits that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk.
*   **Efficient Frontier:** The set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.
*   **Diversification:** "The only free lunch in finance." Reducing risk by owning uncorrelated assets.

## Glossary Definitions

*   **Alpha:** The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index.
*   **Beta:** A measure of the volatility—or systematic risk—of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole.
*   **Rebalancing:** The process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio of assets. (e.g., selling winners and buying losers to get back to the 60/40 target).
