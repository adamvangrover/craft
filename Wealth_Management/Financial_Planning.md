# Financial Planning

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Financial planning is the sticky part of wealth management. A client might move their investment portfolio for better performance, but they are less likely to move if the advisor manages their entire financial life (tax, retirement, education). This creates "stickiness" and stabilizes revenue streams for the firm.

## 1. The Financial Planning Process

Financial planning is a continuous cycle, not a one-time event. The Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board defines a 7-step process:

1.  **Understand the Client's Personal and Financial Circumstances:** Qualitative (goals, values) and quantitative (assets, liabilities) data gathering.
2.  **Identify and Select Goals:** Retirement age, buying a home, funding education.
3.  **Analyze the Current Course of Action:** Are they on track?
4.  **Develop the Financial Planning Recommendation:** What changes are needed?
5.  **Present the Recommendation:** Explain the logic and trade-offs.
6.  **Implement the Recommendation:** Executing trades, buying insurance, setting up trusts.
7.  **Monitor Progress and Update:** Life changes, market changes.

## 2. Key Components

*   **Cash Flow Management:** Budgeting, emergency funds, debt management.
*   **Retirement Planning:** Calculating the "Number" (nest egg needed), Social Security strategies, 401(k)/IRA withdrawals.
*   **Education Planning:** 529 plans, financial aid strategies.
*   **Risk Management (Insurance):** Life, disability, long-term care, property & casualty.
*   **Tax Planning:** Asset location (taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts), tax-loss harvesting, charitable giving.

## 3. The Shift to "Holistic" Planning

In a world where investment management is becoming commoditized (robo-advisors can build a diversified portfolio for 25bps), human advisors must add value through **behavioral coaching** and **complex problem solving**.

> **Pro Tip:**
> The greatest value a financial planner adds is often behavioral—preventing a client from selling everything at the bottom of a market crash. Vanguard calls this "Advisor's Alpha" and estimates it can add ~3% in net returns over time.

## Glossary Definitions

*   **Fiduciary Duty:** The legal and ethical obligation to act in the best interest of the client, putting the client's interests ahead of the advisor's.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:** A mathematical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables (e.g., market returns). Used to test if a retirement plan is robust.
