# Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)

## 1. Introduction

A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of a country's fiat currency that is a direct liability of the central bank. CBDCs are different from other forms of digital currency, such as cryptocurrencies, because they are issued and backed by a central authority.

## 2. Types of CBDCs

There are two main types of CBDCs:

*   **Wholesale CBDCs:** These are used for interbank settlement and other wholesale transactions.
*   **Retail CBDCs:** These are used by the general public for everyday payments.

## 3. Benefits of CBDCs

CBDCs have the potential to provide a number of benefits, including:

*   **Increased efficiency:** CBDCs can make payments more efficient and reduce transaction costs.
*   **Improved financial inclusion:** CBDCs can provide access to financial services for people who are unbanked or underbanked.
*   **Enhanced monetary policy:** CBDCs can give central banks more control over the money supply and interest rates.
*   **Reduced risk of financial crime:** CBDCs can make it more difficult for criminals to use the financial system for illicit activities.

## 4. Risks of CBDCs

CBDCs also pose a number of risks, including:

*   **Cybersecurity risks:** CBDCs could be vulnerable to cyberattacks, which could lead to financial losses and disruptions.
*   **Privacy risks:** CBDCs could collect a large amount of data on users' financial transactions, which could be misused or stolen.
*   **Financial stability risks:** CBDCs could lead to a decline in the use of commercial bank deposits, which could have a negative impact on financial stability.

## 5. Conclusion

CBDCs have the potential to provide a number of benefits, but they also pose a number of risks. Central banks will need to carefully consider these risks before issuing a CBDC.
