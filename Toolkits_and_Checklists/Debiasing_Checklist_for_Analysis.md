# Toolkit: Debiasing Checklist for Financial Analysis

## Introduction

This checklist is a practical job aid designed to be used before finalizing a financial analysis, credit memorandum, or investment recommendation. Its purpose is to force a conscious review of potential behavioral biases that may have influenced the analysis.

It is a companion to the **[Debiasing Techniques for Analysts guide](../../Behavioral_Finance/Debiasing_Techniques_for_Analysts.md)**, which provides more detail on the concepts below.

## How to Use This Checklist

Before finalizing your recommendation, go through these questions honestly. This is not about finding the "right" answer but about promoting self-awareness and more robust thinking.

---

### Section 1: Challenging Your Thesis (Countering Belief Perseverance)

*   `[ ]` **Confirmation Bias:** Have I actively sought out and given fair consideration to information that *contradicts* my thesis? What are the top 3 strongest arguments *against* my recommendation?
*   `[ ]` **Conservatism Bias:** Is my analysis overly anchored to my prior view? If I were looking at this company for the first time today with the latest information, would my conclusion be the same?
*   `[ ]` **Anchoring Bias:** Is my valuation or conclusion heavily influenced by an initial number (e.g., the 52-week high, a previous target price, the deal's announcement price)? What would my valuation be if I ignored that anchor?
*   `[ ]` **Hindsight Bias:** Am I overestimating my ability to have predicted past events? Am I giving management too much or too little credit based on outcomes that may have been due to luck?

### Section 2: Evaluating Your Information & Framing

*   `[ ]` **Availability Heuristic:** Is my thesis based on a vivid, recent news story or a memorable anecdote? Have I grounded my analysis in a systematic review of long-term data rather than what is easiest to recall?
*   `[ ]` **Framing Bias:** Have I framed the decision in multiple ways? (e.g., "reasons to sell" vs. "reasons to buy"; "potential loss" vs. "potential gain").
*   `[ ]` **Representativeness Bias:** Am I categorizing this company as "the next Amazon" or "another Enron" based on superficial similarities? Have I considered the base rates of success/failure for companies in this situation?
*   `[ ]` **Illusion of Control:** Am I overestimating my ability to predict complex variables (e.g., macroeconomic trends, competitive responses)? Have I considered a range of outcomes?

### Section 3: Checking Your Emotional Discipline

*   `[ ]` **Overconfidence Bias:** Have I performed a "pre-mortem"? (i.e., Imagined this decision has failed and listed all the reasons why). What is the probability that I am wrong, and what are the consequences?
*   `[ ]` **Loss Aversion:** Am I holding onto this position to avoid realizing a loss, even though the fundamentals have deteriorated? Am I selling a winner too early to lock in a gain? Does my decision align with my pre-defined process?
*   `[ ]` **Self-Control Bias:** Is this decision driven by short-term market noise or emotion, rather than my long-term strategy and discipline (e.g., as outlined in an Investment Policy Statement)?
*   `[ ]` **Status Quo Bias:** Am I holding this position simply out of inertia? If this were a new investment opportunity today, would I still allocate capital to it based on its merits versus other available opportunities?
*   `[ ]` **Endowment Effect:** Am I overvaluing this asset simply because I (or the firm) already own it?

### Section 4: Final Sanity Check

*   `[ ]` Have I had a colleague with a different viewpoint review my analysis and challenge my assumptions (a "red team" review)?
*   `[ ]` Is my recommendation documented with the key evidence and rationale *before* knowing the outcome?
*   `[ ]` Have I clearly distinguished between facts, reasoned assumptions, and speculation in my analysis?
