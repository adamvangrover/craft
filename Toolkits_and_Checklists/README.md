## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **Practicality is Paramount:** All content in this section must be directly usable and practical. Focus on real-world applicability.
*   **Actionable Format:** Checklists should use Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`) for easy use. Guides should be step-by-step.
*   **Prioritize Future Additions:** The "Future Addition" items listed (Financial Model Review Checklist, Covenant Analysis Checklist, etc.) would provide significant value.
*   **Integration with Interactive Notebooks:** For tools like the "Basic Financial Ratios Calculator," consider if an interactive Jupyter Notebook version could be created in `Interactive_Notebooks/` and linked from the guide here.
*   **Maintainability:** As best practices evolve or new analytical areas emerge, these toolkits may need updating.
