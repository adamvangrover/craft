            <h1>Comprehensive Due Diligence Checklist for Corporate Credit Analysis</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Thorough due diligence is the bedrock of sound credit analysis and prudent lending decisions. This checklist provides a comprehensive framework for gathering and analyzing information about a corporate borrower. It is designed to be adaptable and should be tailored to the specific industry, size, and complexity of the company being analyzed, as well as the nature of the proposed credit facility.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To ensure all critical areas are systematically reviewed, leading to a well-informed credit assessment and mitigation of potential risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Credit analysts, loan officers, risk managers.</p>
            <p><strong>Using This Checklist:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is not necessarily a linear process; information gathering often happens concurrently across areas.</li>
                <li>Mark items as N/A (Not Applicable) if they genuinely do not apply, but consider why.</li>
                <li>Document sources for all information.</li>
                <li>Focus not just on <em>what</em> the information is, but <em>why</em> it's relevant to the company's creditworthiness.</li>
                <li>This checklist should be used in conjunction with detailed financial modeling and ratio analysis.</li>
            </ul>
