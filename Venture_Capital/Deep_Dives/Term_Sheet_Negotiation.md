# Term Sheet Negotiation: Mastering the Fine Print

Negotiating a term sheet is one of the most critical moments in a startup's lifecycle. It sets the financial and control parameters for the partnership between founders and investors.

## 1. Economics: The "Pie"

### Valuation
*   **Pre-Money Valuation**: The value of the company *before* the new investment.
*   **Post-Money Valuation**: Pre-Money + Investment Amount.
    *   *Dilution Formula*: Investment / Post-Money = Investor Ownership %.

### Option Pool Shuffle
Investors often require the employee option pool (typically 10-20%) to be created *in the pre-money*. This dilutes the founders, not the new investors.
*   **Founder Tip**: Negotiate the pool size based on a hiring plan for the next 18 months, rather than a standard arbitrary number.

### Liquidation Preference
Determines who gets paid first in an exit (M&A or IPO).
*   **1x Non-Participating**: Standard. Investor gets their money back OR their share of the proceeds, whichever is higher.
*   **Participating Preferred**: Investor gets their money back AND their share of the remaining proceeds. (Avoid this if possible).

## 2. Control: Who Drives the Bus?

### Board Composition
The Board of Directors hires/fires the CEO and approves major decisions.
*   **Typical Early Stage**: 2 Founders + 1 Lead Investor.
*   **Later Stage**: 2 Founders + 2 Investors + 1 Independent.

### Protective Provisions
Veto rights held by investors on specific actions, regardless of their ownership %.
*   Changing the charter/bylaws.
*   Issuing senior or pari passu securities.
*   Selling the company.
*   Changing the board size.

### Drag-Along Rights
If a majority of shareholders and the board approve a sale, minority shareholders are forced to sell their shares. This prevents a small shareholder from blocking an exit.

## 3. Other Key Clauses

*   **Anti-Dilution**: Protects investors if the company raises money later at a lower valuation ("Down Round").
    *   *Weighted Average* (Standard): Moderate protection.
    *   *Full Ratchet* (Harsh): Converts shares as if the original investment happened at the new lower price.
*   **Pay-to-Play**: Penalizes investors who do not participate in future funding rounds (e.g., converting their preferred stock to common).
*   **No-Shop / Exclusivity**: Prevents the startup from talking to other investors for a set period (usually 30-45 days) while due diligence is completed.

## Negotiation Strategy
1.  **Create Leverage**: Multiple term sheets are the only real leverage.
2.  **Focus on What Matters**: Valuation is important, but control (Board seats) and Liquidation Preference can be more impactful in downside scenarios.
3.  **Use Your Lawyer**: Let legal counsel handle the "bad cop" discussions on standard clauses so you can maintain a good relationship with your future partner.
