# Startup Valuation Methods: Pricing the Unknown

Valuing early-stage startups is more art than science. Without historical financial data or predictable cash flows, traditional DCF models break down. Venture Capitalists use heuristic methods to triangulate a fair price.

## 1. The Berkus Method
Created by angel investor Dave Berkus, this method assigns value to five key drivers of risk reduction.

*   **Sound Idea (Basic Value)**: $0 - $500k
*   **Prototype (Technology Risk)**: +$0 - $500k
*   **Quality Management Team (Execution Risk)**: +$0 - $500k
*   **Strategic Relationships (Market Risk)**: +$0 - $500k
*   **Product Rollout/Sales (Production Risk)**: +$0 - $500k

**Max Valuation**: ~$2.5M (Pre-Money)

## 2. Scorecard Valuation Method
Compares the startup to similar funded startups in the region and adjusts based on weighted factors.

1.  **Determine Average Pre-Money Valuation** of comparable startups (e.g., $6M).
2.  **Compare Factors**:
    *   Strength of Team (30% weight) -> Strong (125%)
    *   Size of Opportunity (25% weight) -> Average (100%)
    *   Product/Tech (15% weight) -> Weak (75%)
    *   Competitive Environment (10% weight)
    *   Marketing/Sales (10% weight)
    *   Need for Additional Investment (5% weight)
    *   Other (5% weight)
3.  **Calculate Multiplier**: Sum of (Weight x Factor Score).
4.  **Result**: Average Valuation x Multiplier.

## 3. The Venture Capital Method
Works backward from a desired exit.

1.  **Estimate Exit Price**: Based on comparable acquisitions (e.g., "SaaS companies sell for 10x ARR").
    *   *Example*: Projected ARR in Year 5 is $10M. Exit at 10x = $100M.
2.  **Determine Target ROI**: VC funds need high returns to offset failures.
    *   *Seed*: 10x - 20x
    *   *Series A*: 5x - 10x
3.  **Calculate Post-Money Valuation**: Exit Price / Target ROI.
    *   $100M / 10x = $10M Post-Money.
4.  **Calculate Pre-Money**: Post-Money - Investment Ask.
    *   If raising $2M: $10M - $2M = $8M Pre-Money.

## 4. Risk Factor Summation Method
Starts with a base valuation (e.g., average for the region) and adds/subtracts monetary value (e.g., +/- $250k) for specific risks:

*   Management Risk
*   Stage of Business
*   Legislation/Political Risk
*   Manufacturing Risk
*   Sales and Marketing Risk
*   Funding/Capital Raising Risk
*   Competition Risk
*   Technology Risk
*   Litigation Risk
*   International Risk
*   Reputation Risk
*   Potential Lucrative Exit

## Conclusion
Smart founders and investors use multiple methods to sanity-check their numbers. Ultimately, the valuation is simply "what the market will bear" — determined by the supply of capital and the demand for the deal.
