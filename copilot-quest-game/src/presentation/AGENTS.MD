This directory contains the presentation script for the Copilot Quest game. The script is written in Markdown and can be converted to a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation.

When making changes to the presentation, please ensure that you follow the existing format and style. Use headings to separate the different sections of the presentation, and use bullet points to list the key talking points.
