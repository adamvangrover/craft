        <h2>Example Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Simple Prompt</h3>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> "What is the primary goal of risk management?"</p>
        <p>This is a clear, direct query that asks for a specific piece of information. It's effective because it's concise and leaves no room for ambiguity.</p>

        <h3>Complex Prompt</h3>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> "Discuss the potential risks and benefits of implementing AI in risk management."</p>
        <p>This prompt is designed to elicit a more detailed and nuanced response. Here's why it's effective:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Balanced View:</strong> It explicitly asks for both risks and benefits, encouraging a comprehensive answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> It focuses on the implementation of AI within the specific domain of risk management.</li>
            <li><strong>Implied Depth:</strong> The word "discuss" implies that a simple list is not sufficient; the response should include analysis and explanation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Practices for Writing Effective Prompts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide Context:</strong> Give the AI some background information to help it understand the request.</li>
            <li><strong>Define the Desired Format:</strong> If you want a list, a paragraph, or a specific structure, say so.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Avoid vague language. The more specific your query, the better the result.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Clear Language:</strong> Don't use jargon or overly complex sentences.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate and Refine:</strong> If you don't get the desired response on the first try, refine your prompt and try again.</li>
        </ul>
