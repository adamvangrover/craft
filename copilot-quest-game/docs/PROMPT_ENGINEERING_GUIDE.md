# Prompt Engineering Guide

## Example Analysis

### Simple Prompt
**Prompt:** "What is the primary goal of risk management?"

This is a clear, direct query that asks for a specific piece of information. It's effective because it's concise and leaves no room for ambiguity.

### Complex Prompt
**Prompt:** "Discuss the potential risks and benefits of implementing AI in risk management."

This prompt is designed to elicit a more detailed and nuanced response. Here's why it's effective:
- **Balanced View:** It explicitly asks for both risks and benefits, encouraging a comprehensive answer.
- **Specificity:** It focuses on the implementation of AI within the specific domain of risk management.
- **Implied Depth:** The word "discuss" implies that a simple list is not sufficient; the response should include analysis and explanation.

## Best Practices for Writing Effective Prompts
- **Provide Context:** Give the AI some background information to help it understand the request.
- **Define the Desired Format:** If you want a list, a paragraph, or a specific structure, say so.
- **Be Specific:** Avoid vague language. The more specific your query, the better the result.
- **Use Clear Language:** Don't use jargon or overly complex sentences.
- **Iterate and Refine:** If you don't get the desired response on the first try, refine your prompt and try again.
