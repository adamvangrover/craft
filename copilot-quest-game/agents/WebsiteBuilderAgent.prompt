Objective: Create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the "Copilot Quest" game website.

Instructions:
1. Create `index.html` with the following sections:
   - A welcome screen with a "Start Game" button.
   - A personality questionnaire screen.
   - A game screen for displaying questions, answers, and AI feedback.
   - A results screen to display final scores and winning team poems.
2. Create `style.css` to provide a professional and fun theme for the website. Include styles for all screens and team-specific colors.
3. Create `script.js` to handle the game logic.
   - Store all questions, answers, categories, and feedback in JavaScript objects.
   - Implement a function to handle the personality questionnaire and team assignment.
   - Implement functions to display questions and answers for each round.
   - Implement an event listener for answer submissions.
   - Implement a function to check answers, update scores, and display AI feedback.
   - Implement logic to transition between game rounds and display the final results.

Developer Notes:
- The `script.js` file is the core of the game's functionality. It should be well-commented and easy to understand.
- The personality quiz is a key feature of the game. The team assignment logic should be fair and balanced.
- The game's data (questions, answers, etc.) is stored in JavaScript objects. This makes it easy to add or modify the game's content.
- The website should be responsive and work well on a variety of devices.
- Consider adding animations and sound effects to make the game more engaging.
