Objective: Create the main directory structure for the "Copilot Quest" game.

Instructions:
1. Create the following directories:
   - `/docs`
   - `/src/website/css`
   - `/src/website/js`
   - `/src/website/images`
   - `/src/presentation`
   - `/agents`
2. Trigger the `DocsWriterAgent` to populate the `/docs` directory and the root `README.md`.
3. Trigger the `WebsiteBuilderAgent` to populate the `/src/website` directory.
4. Trigger the `PresentationCreatorAgent` to populate the `/src/presentation` directory.

Developer Notes:
- This agent is the first to be run. It sets up the entire repository structure.
- The order of agent execution is important. The `RepoBuilderAgent` must run before the other agents.
- This agent could be extended to take a configuration file as input, allowing for different repository structures to be created.
