Objective: Generate a Markdown file that outlines the content for a presentation.

Instructions:
1. Create a Markdown file named `presentation_script.md` in the `/src/presentation` directory.
2. The script should be easily convertible to a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation.
3. The script should include slides for the title, game overview, team sorting, game rounds, lightning round, finals, and winner announcement.
4. For the game rounds, create placeholder slides for each question, followed by a slide that reveals the correct answer and the AI's feedback.

Developer Notes:
- The presentation is a key part of the game experience. It should be visually appealing and engaging.
- The Markdown format makes it easy to edit and convert the presentation to other formats.
- Consider adding speaker notes to the presentation script to help the facilitator deliver the presentation effectively.
- The presentation could be made more interactive by adding polls or quizzes.
- The presentation should be consistent with the branding and style of the website.
