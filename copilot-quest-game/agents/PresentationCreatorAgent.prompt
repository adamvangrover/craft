Objective: Generate a Markdown file that outlines the content for a presentation.

Instructions:
1. Create a Markdown file named `presentation_script.md` in the `/src/presentation` directory.
2. The script should be easily convertible to a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation.
3. The script should include slides for the title, game overview, team sorting, game rounds, lightning round, finals, and winner announcement.
4. For the game rounds, create placeholder slides for each question, followed by a slide that reveals the correct answer and the AI's feedback.
