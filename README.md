### How to Navigate This Repository

1.  **Start with `home.html`:** This [interactive dashboard](./home.html) is the best starting point. It offers role-based navigation and direct links to key areas.
2.  **Explore by Pillar:** Use the links in the "Repository Structure" section above to dive into specific topics of interest. Each pillar's `README.md` or `index.html` will provide further guidance.
3.  **Follow a Learning Path:** If you have a specific goal (e.g., becoming a credit analyst), check the [Learning Paths section](./Learning_Paths/index.html).
4.  **Use the Search Function (GitHub):** If you're looking for specific keywords or topics, GitHub's search functionality can be very helpful.
5.  **Consult the `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`:** For definitions of common financial terms.

### Understanding File Types (Helper Files Overview)

*   **`.md` (Markdown Files):** The core content of the repository is written in Markdown. These files contain the textual information, explanations, case studies, and quiz questions.
    *   Many `README.md` files act as introductory guides for their respective directories.
    *   Specialized viewers like `global_markdown_viewer.html` and `quiz_viewer.html` are used to render these for a better user experience, especially for quizzes.
*   **`.html` (HTML Files):**
    *   `index.html` files in many directories serve as user-friendly landing pages or interactive dashboards for that section, often providing navigation trees or summaries.
    *   `home.html` is the main interactive entry point for the entire repository.
    *   Some content, like certain primers or specialized views (e.g., `copilot.html` in CRAFT), is directly presented in HTML.
*   **`.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebooks):** Found in the `Interactive_Notebooks/` directory. These offer hands-on coding exercises and financial model examples, primarily using Python. They often come with associated `data/` folders containing CSV or JSON files.
*   **`.json` (JSON Files):** Used for structured data, such as the `sample_credit_agreement_clauses.json` for notebook exercises or the `example_initial_prompt.json` which outlines the foundational AI prompt for this repo.
*   **`AGENTS.MD`:** These files (note the uppercase) provide specific instructions or tips for AI agents (like me!) working with the codebase. They might contain coding conventions, organizational details, or testing instructions relevant to their directory and subdirectories.
*   **Supporting Files:**
    *   `assets/`, `css/`, `js/`: These folders contain images, stylesheets (for visual presentation), and JavaScript code (for interactivity and dynamic content loading in HTML pages).

## The Genesis of This Repository: An AI-Powered Approach

This repository was significantly shaped by an initial, detailed prompt provided to an AI model. The aim was to create a comprehensive learning resource for credit analysis and related financial topics.

You can view the (slightly abridged) foundational prompt that guided the AI in generating the initial structure and much of the content here:
‚û°Ô∏è **[View the Example Initial Prompt](./example_initial_prompt.json)**

This approach allowed for the rapid creation of a broad and deep set of learning materials. The AI was tasked with:
*   Structuring the overall repository.
*   Developing curriculum for programs like CRAFT.
*   Generating content for modules, primers, and deep dives.
*   Creating examples, case studies, and quiz questions.

The ongoing development involves refining this AI-generated content, adding new materials, and ensuring accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness, often with the assistance of AI tools for specific tasks.

## New Topics & Future Development

This Financial Learning Hub is a dynamic project. We envision expanding its scope to include:

*   **Advanced Financial Modeling:** Deeper dives into LBOs, M&A, project finance, and other complex model types.
*   **Quantitative Finance:** More on derivatives pricing, risk modeling (VaR, CVaR), and algorithmic trading strategies.
*   **Sustainable & ESG Investing:** Dedicated modules on Environmental, Social, and Governance factors in investment analysis.
*   **Real Estate Finance:** Specific models and case studies for property valuation and investment.
*   **Private Equity & Venture Capital:** Detailed exploration of these asset classes.
*   **International Finance & Markets:** Content on currency markets, international trade finance, and global economic analysis.
*   **Regulatory Environments:** Updates and analysis of evolving financial regulations across key jurisdictions.
*   **More Interactive Tools:** Expanding the suite of Jupyter notebooks and potentially adding other interactive web-based tools.
*   **Career Development Resources:** More focused content on interview preparation, networking, and career paths in finance.

We welcome suggestions for new topics! Please raise an issue if you have ideas.

*The very detailed excerpt from the CRAFT program (Module 1 & 2) has been moved to the `example_initial_prompt.json` file to keep this main README concise and focused on overall navigation and structure.*
The "Works Cited" section previously at the end of this README was part of that excerpt and has also been moved.
