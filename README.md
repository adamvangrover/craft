# Financial Learning Hub & Active Learning Ecosystem

**Welcome to your central hub for comprehensive financial learning and professional development!**

This repository is an integrated **Active Learning Ecosystem** for students, aspiring analysts, and seasoned finance professionals. Unlike static textbooks, this hub encourages you to *do*, *decide*, and *simulate* as you learn. Our goal is to develop top-tier credit risk analysts through rigorous content and interactive experiences.

**🚀 Quick Start: [Explore the Dashboard (home.html)](./home.html) 🚀**

The `home.html` page is your command center. It features:
*   **Personalized Learning Paths:** Tailored journeys for Credit Analysts, CFA® Candidates, and Wealth Managers.
*   **Active Simulations:** "Choose Your Own Adventure" style scenarios where you make the call on real-world credit deals.
*   **Deep Dives:** Advanced modules on Sustainable Finance, Wealth Management, and more.
*   **Global Navigation Sidebar:** A comprehensive tree view of all content (`js/nav_data.js`).
*   **AI Concept Explainer:** Instant, simple explanations for complex financial terms.

## Our Philosophy: The "Active Learning" Approach

We believe finance is a trade, not just a theory. We treat you as a **Junior Analyst**, not a student.

> **Read our full [Pedagogical Manifesto (PEDAGOGY.md)](./PEDAGOGY.md) to understand how this ecosystem is designed to build "Buy-Side" judgement.**

*   **Don't just read about Credit Risk...** [Run the "Distressed Retailer" Credit Committee Simulation](./Interactive_Notebooks/Simulations/Credit_Committee_Simulation_Guide.md).
*   **Don't just memorize the Green Bond Principles...** [Analyze a Green Bond Framework](./Sustainable_Finance/Deep_Dives/Green_Bond_Framework_Analysis.md) and spot the greenwashing.
*   **Don't just list behavioral biases...** [Diagnose a client panic](./Wealth_Management/Deep_Dives/Behavioral_Biases_in_Client_Portfolios.md) in the Wealth Management simulator.
