# Future Ideas & Potential Enhancements for CRAFT Program

This document captures potential ideas for future development and expansion of the Credit Risk Analyst Foundations Training (CRAFT) program.

## I. Interactive HTML Guide Enhancements:

*   **Deep Linking with URL Hashes:** Implement functionality so that specific modules or even sections within modules can be directly linked to using URL fragments (e.g., `index.html#module3/section2`).
*   **Collapsible Navigation Sections:** For the sidebar navigation, allow Parts or Modules with many sub-files to be collapsed/expanded to improve usability as the course grows.
*   **Search Functionality:** Add a client-side search bar to search keywords within the currently loaded markdown content, or potentially across all module titles/summaries.
*   **Simple Progress Tracking (Client-Side):** Use local storage to allow users to mark modules or sections as "complete" for their own tracking.
*   **Improved Internal Linking:** Develop a more robust way for links *within* loaded markdown content (that point to other `.md` files in the course) to be intercepted by the JavaScript loader, rather than behaving as standard relative HTML links. This might involve post-processing the HTML rendered by `marked.js`.
*   **Accessibility Enhancements (ARIA):** Add ARIA attributes to the HTML guide for better screen reader support, especially for dynamic navigation elements.
*   **Print-Friendly Styles:** Develop CSS for a cleaner print output if users want to print specific content sections from the HTML guide.

## II. New Module Content & Expansions:

*   **Additional Specialized Industry Case Studies (Module 16):**
    *   Retail (Brick & Mortar vs. E-commerce)
    *   Manufacturing (e.g., Automotive, Industrial)
    *   Real Estate (e.g., Commercial REITs - Office, Retail, Industrial)
    *   Healthcare (e.g., Hospitals, Pharma/Biotech)
    *   Energy (e.g., Oil & Gas E&P, Renewables)
*   **Excel Model Templates (Downloadable):**
    *   Provide actual downloadable Excel shell templates for:
        *   Basic 3-statement model (Module 2).
        *   Supporting schedules (Debt, PP&E, Working Capital) (Module 2).
        *   Simplified LBO Model (Module 9).
        *   Simplified M&A Pro Forma Model (Module 9).
*   **Deeper Dive into Specific Accounting Topics (Module 1, 12):**
    *   Inventory analysis (obsolescence, valuation methods).
    *   Goodwill and Intangibles (impairment testing).
    *   Pensions and OPEB.
    *   Deferred Taxes.
    *   More detailed Quality of Earnings (QoE) techniques and case studies.
*   **Advanced Debt Structuring Topics (Module 13):**
    *   Detailed Debt Capacity Analysis.
    *   Intercreditor Agreement basics and key dispute areas.
    *   Valuation for Recovery Analysis (more depth).
    *   Brief comparison of international restructuring regimes.
*   **Advanced Legal Topics (Module 14):**
    *   Lender liability risks.
    *   Equitable subordination.
    *   More detail on UCC Article 9 provisions or international equivalents.
*   **Advanced Business Writing & Communication (Module 15, 17):**
    *   Visual storytelling in credit memos (use of charts/graphs).
    *   Handling "bad news" or decline recommendations.
    *   Cross-cultural communication nuances.
    *   Dedicated module on "Presentation Skills for Financial Analysts."
*   **Advanced Data Analytics & Quant Tools (Module 19):**
    *   Simple, commented Python/R code snippets for demonstration.
    *   Introduction to Time Series Analysis concepts.
    *   Data cleaning and preparation overview.
*   **Generative AI Deep Dive (Module 11 or New Module):**
    *   Prompt engineering for financial analysis.
    *   Risks of hallucinations with LLMs.
    *   Data privacy considerations when using LLMs with financial data.
*   **Regulatory Landscape Updates (Module 18):**
    *   More jurisdictional comparisons (e.g., EU, major Asian markets).
    *   Role of RegTech (Regulatory Technology).

## III. Interactive Exercises & Multimedia:

*   **Interactive Quizzes/Exercises:** Beyond multiple choice/short answer, develop:
    *   Drag-and-drop classification exercises (e.g., for accounts, covenant types).
    *   "Spot the Red Flag" or "Spot the Shenanigan" interactive scenarios.
    *   Simple model input widgets to see immediate output changes.
*   **Video Content:**
    *   Short video tutorials explaining complex concepts (e.g., 3-statement model linkages, LBO structure, a specific legal clause).
    *   Interviews with industry professionals (credit analysts, portfolio managers, lawyers, PE sponsors) discussing their roles and insights.
    *   Animated explanations of financial flows or legal structures.

## IV. Technical & Platform Enhancements:

*   **More Robust Front-End Framework:** If the HTML guide becomes very complex, consider using a simple JavaScript framework (like Vue.js or Svelte for lightweight SPAs) for better component management and state handling, though this moves away from "simple client-side only" if not managed carefully.
*   **Automated Testing for Course Content:**
    *   Linters for markdown consistency.
    *   Automated checks for broken internal links (if a site generator is used).
*   **Potential for a Static Site Generator (SSG):**
    *   Tools like Jekyll, Hugo, or Eleventy could be used to build a more sophisticated static site from the markdown files, which would handle navigation, templating, and potentially pre-rendering content. This would improve performance and maintainability for a very large course but adds a build step.
*   **Real-Time Data Integration (Aspirational):**
    *   For advanced modules, explore ways to (conceptually or actually) integrate examples using publicly available financial data APIs for market rates, company data snippets, etc. (High complexity).

## V. Course Management & Pedagogy:

*   **Learning Paths:** For different analyst roles (e.g., corporate banking analyst, leveraged finance analyst, distressed debt analyst), suggest specific module sequences or areas of focus.
*   **Community Features (if hosted on a suitable platform):**
    *   Discussion forums per module.
    *   Ability for users to ask questions.
*   **Certification/Assessment:** More formal final assessment or certification process if desired.

This list provides a rich backlog of potential improvements to continuously enhance the CRAFT program. Prioritization would depend on user feedback, available resources, and learning objectives.
