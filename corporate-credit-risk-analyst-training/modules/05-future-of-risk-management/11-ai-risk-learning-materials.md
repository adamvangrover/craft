# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 11 - The Future of Risk Management: AI, Data Analytics, and the Evolving Analyst

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 11)

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers; the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.
*   **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where systems automatically learn and improve from experience (data) without being explicitly programmed.
    *   **Supervised Learning:** ML using labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately (e.g., default prediction based on historical defaults).
    *   **Unsupervised Learning:** ML using algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets, discovering hidden patterns or intrinsic structures (e.g., customer segmentation).
    *   **Regression Algorithms:** Supervised learning algorithms that predict a continuous output value (e.g., predicting Loss Given Default).
    *   **Classification Algorithms:** Supervised learning algorithms that predict a discrete class label (e.g., predicting if a loan will default or not).
    *   **Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks:** Examples of ML algorithms.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** A subfield of AI focused on enabling computers to process, understand, interpret, and generate human language (text and speech).
*   **Alternative Data:** Non-traditional data sources that can be used in credit assessment (e.g., bank transaction data, utility payments, social media activity, satellite imagery, supply chain information).
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Using NLP to identify and extract subjective information (positive, negative, neutral sentiment) from text data (e.g., news articles, social media, earnings calls).
*   **Information Extraction:** Automatically identifying and pulling structured information from unstructured or semi-structured text sources (e.g., extracting covenant terms from credit agreements).
*   **Generative AI (GenAI):** AI models (like Large Language Models - LLMs) capable of creating new content, including text, images, code, or synthetic data.
*   **Large Language Model (LLM):** A type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language (e.g., GPT series).
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** AI models and techniques designed to make the decisions and predictions of AI systems understandable and interpretable by humans, addressing the "black box" problem.
    *   **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** A game theory approach to explain the output of any machine learning model.
    *   **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** A technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction.
*   **Data Bias:** Systematic errors or prejudices in data that can lead AI models trained on that data to produce unfair, inaccurate, or discriminatory outcomes.
*   **Algorithmic Bias:** Bias that occurs when an AI system reflects the implicit values of the humans who created it, the data it was trained on, or the way it is used.
*   **Model Risk Management (MRM):** The framework and processes for managing risks associated with the use of models, including their development, implementation, validation, and ongoing monitoring. Crucial for AI/ML models.
*   **Model Drift (Concept Drift):** The degradation of a model's predictive power over time as the statistical properties of the input data or the relationship between inputs and outputs change.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** A model of interaction where human intelligence is integrated with AI systems, with humans overseeing, validating, or correcting AI outputs, especially in critical decision-making.
*   **Data Governance:** The overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed in an organization or an AI system.

## Conceptual Discussion Points for Deeper Understanding

*   **Evolution vs. Revolution:** Is AI a complete revolution in credit risk, or an evolution of existing quantitative techniques? Discuss arguments for both sides.
*   **Data as the New "Collateral"?** To what extent can alternative data and sophisticated AI models reduce reliance on traditional collateral in lending decisions, especially for underserved segments?
*   **The "Build vs. Buy" Decision for AI Tools:** What are the pros and cons for a financial institution developing its own AI/ML capabilities versus partnering with or buying solutions from specialized fintech vendors?
*   **Regulatory Lag:** How quickly can (or should) regulators adapt to the rapid pace of AI development in finance? What are the risks of over-regulation vs. under-regulation?
*   **Impact on Credit Analyst Skills:** Beyond what's in the module, what specific new skills (technical or soft) will be most valuable for credit analysts in an AI-augmented future? (e.g., basic coding for data analysis, understanding model validation reports, ability to critically question AI outputs, data ethics).
*   **Small vs. Large Institutions:** How might the adoption and impact of AI in credit risk differ between large, global banks and smaller, community-focused lenders?

*(Note: This field is evolving extremely rapidly. Continuous learning and staying updated on new developments, research, and regulatory guidance are essential.)*
