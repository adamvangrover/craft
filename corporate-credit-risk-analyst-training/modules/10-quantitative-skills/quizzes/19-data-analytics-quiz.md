**Part 1: Multiple Choice (Select the best answer)**

1.  Which advanced Excel feature is particularly useful for quickly summarizing and analyzing large datasets by slicing and dicing data across different categories (e.g., delinquencies by industry and region)?
    a)  Solver Add-in
    b)  Statistical Functions like `AVERAGE`
    c)  PivotTables
    d)  Conditional Formatting

2.  Conceptually, what is a primary advantage of using programming languages like Python or R for data analysis in credit risk compared to only using Excel?
    a)  They are much easier for complete beginners to learn.
    b)  They can handle much larger datasets and automate complex, repetitive data processing tasks more efficiently.
    c)  They have built-in credit scoring models that require no customization.
    d)  They replace the need for any qualitative credit judgment.

3.  When creating a data visualization to show the trend of a company's revenue over the past five years, which chart type is generally most appropriate?
    a)  Pie chart
    b)  Scatter plot
    c)  Line chart
    d)  Histogram

4.  Analyzing portfolio data to identify if credit risk is overly concentrated in a specific industry or geographic region is an example of:
    a)  Probability of Default (PD) modeling.
    b)  Portfolio Segmentation & Analysis.
    c)  Loss Given Default (LGD) estimation.
    d)  Data cleaning and transformation.

5.  A key ethical consideration when using data analytics for credit risk modeling is:
    a)  Ensuring the model is as complex as possible to impress regulators.
    b)  Using as many variables as possible, regardless of their relevance.
    c)  Making sure the data used does not perpetuate or amplify societal biases, leading to unfair outcomes.
    d)  Keeping the model's methodology a complete secret from everyone, including internal validators.

6.  "Correlation does not imply causation" means that:
    a)  If two variables are correlated, one must have caused the other.
    b)  Data analysis cannot identify any relationships between variables.
    c)  Just because two variables move together does not mean that one directly causes the movement in the other; there could be a third factor or it could be coincidental.
    d)  Causation can only be determined by using AI and machine learning.

**Part 2: True/False (Indicate whether the statement is True or False)**

7.  True or False: Python's `Pandas` library is primarily used for creating advanced 3D graphics for presentations.
8.  True or False: Effective data visualization aims to present as much data as possible on a single chart, even if it appears cluttered, to show thoroughness.
9.  True or False: Logistic regression is a statistical technique that can be used to model the probability of a binary outcome, such as default/no default.
10. True or False: "Overfitting" a statistical model means it performs exceptionally well on new, unseen data but poorly on the historical data it was trained on.
