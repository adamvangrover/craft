## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 08 - Specialized Industries

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`08-specialized-industries/`) focuses on analyzing specialized industries, primarily through case studies and highlighting unique KPIs and risk factors.

The main guide is `README.md`. Core content is likely in `16-specialized-industry-case-studies.md` and supported by notes and learning materials files. Case studies and quizzes are in their respective subdirectories.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** `16-specialized-industry-case-studies.md` is central. Its role (general guide vs. actual cases) needs to be clear, as noted in its `README.md`.
*   **Supporting Notes:** `developer-notes.md` and `teacher-notes.md` provide context for this lesson.
*   **Case Studies Subdirectory:** The `case-studies/` folder (e.g., with `16-saas-case-study-guidance.md`) is critical for this module's case-based approach.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Developing more diverse and detailed industry case studies is key.
    *   Ensuring each case study clearly outlines industry-specific KPIs, risk factors, and analytical adjustments.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Industry Nuance:** For each specialized industry discussed, clearly articulate what makes it different from "general corporates."
*   **KPIs:** Define and explain the relevance of industry-specific Key Performance Indicators.
*   **Risk Factors:** Highlight unique risks inherent to the industry (e.g., regulatory risk in utilities, commodity price risk in O&G, subscriber churn in SaaS).
*   **Analytical Adjustments:** Explain how standard financial analysis or valuation might need to be modified.
*   **Case Study Structure:** Ensure case studies provide sufficient background, data, and clear questions that require application of specialized industry knowledge. Guideline answers are essential.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   **Crucially link to `/primers/`:** The industry primers provide foundational overviews that this module builds upon with deeper analytical techniques and case studies.
*   Link terms to local CRAFT `GLOSSARY.md` and `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Connect to Module 4 (Industry Analysis) for general frameworks like Porter's Five Forces, then show how they're adapted here.
*   If specific modeling is involved for an industry, link to `/Financial_Modeling/`.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   Clarify/structure `16-specialized-industry-case-studies.md`.
*   Develop full case studies for Real Estate, Oil & Gas, Financial Institutions, Healthcare, etc.
*   Standardize case study format.
*   Create KPI glossaries for each featured industry.
