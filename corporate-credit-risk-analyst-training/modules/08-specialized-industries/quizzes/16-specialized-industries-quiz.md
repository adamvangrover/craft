    b)  Understand the unique business models, KPIs, risks, and success factors specific to that industry.
    c)  Apply a standardized set of financial ratios regardless of the industry.
    d)  Focus solely on macroeconomic trends affecting all industries.

2.  In the SaaS industry, Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is a critical KPI because it represents:

    c)  The normalized, predictable revenue a company expects to receive from subscriptions over a twelve-month period.
    d)  The company's net profit after all operating expenses.

3.  A SaaS company with an LTV/CAC ratio of 1.5x generally indicates:
    a)  A very healthy and efficient customer acquisition model.
    b)  That the lifetime value of a customer is significantly higher than the cost to acquire them.
    c)  A potentially unsustainable model where the cost to acquire customers is too high relative to their lifetime value.
    d)  That the company is likely to be highly profitable in the short term.

4.  Net Revenue Retention (NRR) greater than 100% for a SaaS company implies that:
    a)  The company is not losing any customers to churn.
    b)  The company's new customer acquisition is growing rapidly.
    c)  Existing customers, on average, are increasing their spending (through upgrades, cross-sells) by more than what is lost from customers who churn or downgrade.
    d)  The company has very high gross margins.

5.  Which of the following is a unique risk particularly pronounced in the SaaS industry?
    a)  Fluctuations in raw material prices.
    b)  High customer churn if the product is not sticky or value is not delivered.
    c)  Need for extensive physical distribution networks.
    d)  Significant environmental regulatory compliance costs.

6.  When analyzing a growth-stage SaaS company with negative net income, a credit analyst should pay close attention to:
    a)  Its dividend payout ratio.
    b)  Its fixed asset turnover ratio.
    c)  Its cash burn rate, liquidity runway, and the quality of its recurring revenue.
    d)  Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

**Part 2: True/False (Indicate whether the statement is True or False)**

7.  True or False: For a SaaS company, "Bookings" in a period are always equal to "Revenue" recognized in that same period.
8.  True or False: A short CAC Payback Period (e.g., < 12 months) is generally considered unfavorable for a SaaS business as it means they are not investing enough in growth.
9.  True or False: High gross margins (e.g., 70-80%+) are atypical for mature, scalable SaaS companies.
10. True or False: The "Rule of 40" suggests that a healthy SaaS company's revenue growth rate plus its customer churn rate should exceed 40%.
