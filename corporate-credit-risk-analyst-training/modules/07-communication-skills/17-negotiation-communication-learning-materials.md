## Conceptual Tools & Frameworks (Beyond this Module's Content)

*   **Active Listening Checklist:**
    *   Maintain eye contact (culturally appropriate).
    *   Show engagement (nodding, verbal cues like "uh-huh").
    *   Avoid interrupting (unless for essential clarification).
    *   Paraphrase to confirm understanding ("So, if I hear you correctly, you're saying...").
    *   Ask clarifying and open-ended follow-up questions.
    *   Suspend judgment while listening.
*   **Feedback Model (e.g., SBI - Situation, Behavior, Impact):**
    *   **Situation:** Describe the specific context. ("During yesterday's credit committee presentation...")
    *   **Behavior:** Describe the observable behavior. ("...when you were asked about the downside revenue scenario, you seemed unsure of the specific assumptions.")
    *   **Impact:** Describe the impact of that behavior. ("...this made it appear you hadn't fully stress-tested that variable, which weakened the committee's confidence in the projections.")
*   **Negotiation Preparation Checklist:**
    1.  What are my objectives (ideal, acceptable, walk-away)?
    2.  What are the likely objectives of the other party?
    3.  What are our respective interests underlying these positions?
    4.  What is my BATNA? What is their likely BATNA?
    5.  What objective criteria or standards can I use to support my points?
    6.  What are potential areas of compromise or creative solutions?
    7.  What is my opening strategy? What concessions am I willing/unwilling to make?
*   **Stakeholder Analysis Map (for complex internal negotiations):**
    *   Identify all key stakeholders.
    *   What is their interest/stake in the decision?
    *   What is their level of influence?
    *   What are their likely positions/concerns?
    *   How can I best communicate with and influence each stakeholder?

*(Note: These "soft" skills are best developed through conscious practice, observation, seeking feedback, and self-reflection in real-world interactions.)*
