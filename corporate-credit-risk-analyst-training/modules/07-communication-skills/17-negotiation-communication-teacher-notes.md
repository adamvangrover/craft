# Teacher Notes: Module 17 - Negotiation & Communication Skills for Credit Analysts

## Module Learning Objectives for Instructor Focus:

*   Students must recognize that **soft skills are critical complements** to technical analytical abilities for a successful credit analyst.
*   Understand key aspects of **internal communication**: effectively presenting to credit committees, collaborating (and sometimes constructively disagreeing) with Relationship Managers/Sales, and interacting with other internal teams.
*   Appreciate the nuances of **external communication**, primarily with borrowers for information gathering and discussing issues (often alongside RMs).
*   Internalize core communication skills: **active listening, clear verbal articulation, effective questioning techniques, and giving/receiving constructive feedback.**
*   Introduce **basic negotiation principles** relevant to an analyst's role (preparation, focusing on interests, BATNA).
*   Reinforce **ethical considerations** in all professional communication and negotiation.

## Key Concepts to Emphasize:

*   **Communication as a Two-Way Street:** Active listening is as important as clear speaking.
*   **Audience Awareness:** Tailoring the message, style, and level of detail to the listener/reader.
*   **Preparation in Communication:** Thinking before speaking/presenting; anticipating questions.
*   **Constructive Conflict:** Disagreements are normal; managing them professionally to reach better outcomes.
*   **Interests vs. Positions in Negotiation:** The key to finding mutually acceptable solutions.
*   **BATNA as a Source of Power/Leverage:** Knowing your walk-away alternative.
*   **Professionalism and Ethics:** Non-negotiable foundations for all interactions.
*   **Soft Skills are Developed through Practice:** This module provides concepts; application is key.

## Potential Discussion Questions & Activities:

1.  **"Worst Presentation" Debrief:** "Think about a presentation you've seen (or given!) that was ineffective. What made it ineffective from a communication standpoint? How could it have been improved using principles from this module?"
2.  **RM vs. Analyst Role Play:**
    *   Scenario: RM wants to push for a loan with very loose covenants for a key client. Analyst has concerns about the risk.
    *   Have two students role-play the discussion. Focus on how the analyst can communicate their concerns effectively while maintaining a constructive relationship with the RM. Debrief on communication styles used.
3.  **Active Listening Exercise:**
    *   Pair students. One speaks for 2 minutes on a non-controversial topic. The other practices active listening (no interrupting, just listening, then paraphrasing back what they heard). Switch roles. Discuss how it felt to be truly listened to, and how hard it was to just listen.
4.  **Negotiation Scenario (Simple):** "You (analyst) believe a specific piece of information is critical for your analysis, but the borrower is hesitant to provide it, citing confidentiality. How might you try to negotiate access to this information or find an alternative way to address your concern?"
5.  **Ethical Dilemma Discussion:** "An RM subtly suggests you might want to 'adjust' a projection slightly to make a borderline deal look better for credit committee. How do you handle this communication ethically and professionally?"
6.  **Feedback Practice:** "Imagine a colleague analyst wrote a section of a credit memo that was unclear and missed some key risks. Using the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model, how would you provide constructive feedback to them?"

## Common Student Misconceptions/Challenges:

*   **Soft Skills as "Optional" or Innate:** Not seeing them as skills that can and must be developed.
*   **Fear of Conflict:** Avoiding necessary disagreements, especially with more senior colleagues or RMs.
*   **Passive Listening:** Hearing but not truly understanding or processing information.
*   **Negotiation as Confrontation Only:** Not understanding interest-based or win-win approaches.
*   **Difficulty Giving/Receiving Feedback:** Taking feedback personally or giving unhelpful (too vague or too harsh) feedback.
*   **Underestimating Preparation for "Informal" Communications:** Thinking that only formal presentations require preparation.

## Activity Ideas:

*   **Impromptu Speaking Practice:** Give students a credit-related topic (e.g., "Explain 'leverage' to a non-financial manager") and 1-2 minutes to prepare a short, clear verbal explanation.
*   **"Questioning the CEO" Exercise:** Provide a brief company scenario. Have students brainstorm a list of open-ended, probing, and clarifying questions they would ask the CEO in a due diligence meeting.
*   **Analyze a Recorded Interaction (if available):** Show a (non-sensitive) video of a business meeting or negotiation. Have students identify examples of good and poor communication techniques.
*   **Develop a Personal "Communication Improvement Plan":** Ask students to identify 1-2 communication skills they want to focus on and list 2-3 specific actions they can take to practice and improve.

## Instructor Notes for Delivery:

*   **Emphasize Practice:** These skills are learned by doing. Encourage students to apply these concepts in their daily interactions.
*   **Use Role-Playing:** This is one of the most effective ways to practice communication and negotiation in a safe environment. Keep scenarios short and focused.
*   **Facilitate Discussion, Don't Lecture:** This module lends itself well to interactive discussions and sharing of experiences.
*   **Model Good Behavior:** Demonstrate active listening, clear communication, and constructive feedback in your own interactions with the students.
*   **Keep it Real:** Relate concepts to tangible situations analysts will face (credit committees, RM discussions, client calls).
*   **Positive Framing:** Focus on how these skills enhance effectiveness and career growth.
