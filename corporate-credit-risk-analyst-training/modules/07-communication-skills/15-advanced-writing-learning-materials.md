# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 15 - Advanced Business Writing: Persuasion & Narrative in Credit Memos

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 15)

*   **Persuasive Writing (in Credit):** The art of structuring an evidence-based argument within a credit memorandum to logically lead the reader to the analyst's well-reasoned conclusion and recommendation, while maintaining objectivity.
*   **Credit Narrative:** The overarching "story" or cohesive argument that synthesizes all quantitative and qualitative analysis to justify a credit recommendation.
*   **Credit Thesis:** The central argument or main point of the credit narrative; the core message the analyst wants to convey about the creditworthiness and recommendation.
*   **Strategic Framing:** Positioning a credit request or analysis within the broader strategic context of the borrower, the lender, and the market.
*   **Audience Adaptation:** Tailoring the content, style, level of detail, and emphasis of a written communication to suit the specific needs and perspectives of different readers (e.g., credit committee, senior management, RMs).
*   **Precision in Language:** Using words carefully to convey exact meaning, avoiding vagueness or ambiguity.
*   **Parallel Structure:** Using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level of importance. Often used in lists or series.
*   **Sentence Variety:** Mixing short, declarative sentences with longer, more complex (but still clear) sentences to maintain reader engagement and improve flow.
*   **Tone (Professional):** The attitude conveyed in writing. In credit memos, it should be objective, analytical, confident (but not arrogant), and respectful.
*   **Argumentation:** The process of forming reasons, justifying beliefs, and drawing conclusions with the aim of influencing the thoughts or actions of others.
*   **Claim (in Argumentation):** The main assertion or conclusion the writer is trying to make (e.g., the credit recommendation).
*   **Evidence (Grounds/Data - in Argumentation):** The facts, data, financial analysis, and qualitative assessments used to support the claim.
*   **Warrant (in Argumentation):** The logical connection, underlying principle, or reasoning that explains how the evidence supports the claim.
*   **Counter-Argument:** An argument or set of reasons put forward to oppose an idea or theory developed in another argument. Proactively addressing these strengthens a credit memo.

## Recommended Reading & External Resources

*   **Building on Module 5 Resources:** Revisit recommended books like "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White), "On Writing Well" (Zinsser), and "HBR Guide to Better Business Writing" (Garner) with a focus now on their application to constructing persuasive arguments.
*   **Books on Persuasion, Argumentation, and Rhetoric:**
    *   "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" by Robert Cialdini (While focused on broader persuasion, many principles apply to structuring influential arguments).
    *   "Thank You for Arguing: What Aristotle, Lincoln, and Homer Simpson Can Teach Us About the Art of Persuasion" by Jay Heinrichs (A more accessible take on rhetoric).
    *   "A Rulebook for Arguments" by Anthony Weston (A concise guide to building good arguments).
*   **Resources on Logical Fallacies (to avoid them in your arguments and spot them in others'):**
    *   Websites like "Thou Shalt Not Commit Logical Fallacies" ([https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/))
    *   Many university writing center websites have excellent guides on logical fallacies.
*   **Examples of Strong Analytical Writing:**
    *   Well-regarded equity research reports (especially the summary/thesis sections).
    *   High-quality financial journalism (e.g., in-depth pieces in The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Economist). Analyze *how* they structure their arguments and present evidence.
    *   (If available and permitted) Examples of well-written internal credit memos within your own institution.

## Conceptual Tools & Frameworks (Beyond this Module's Content)

*   **Advanced Credit Memo Structure Outline:**
    *   A more granular outline than in Module 5, perhaps with prompts for each sub-section on how to weave in the narrative, address specific audience concerns, and build the argument towards the recommendation.
*   **Argumentation Framework Checklist:**
    *   Based on concepts like Toulmin model (Claim, Evidence, Warrant, Backing, Rebuttal, Qualifier).
    *   Prompts:
        *   What is my primary claim/recommendation?
        *   What is the strongest evidence supporting it?
        *   What is the underlying reasoning (warrant) linking evidence to claim?
        *   What further backing supports my warrant?
        *   What are potential rebuttals/counter-arguments? How have I addressed them?
        *   Have I used appropriate qualifiers where certainty isn't absolute?
*   **Audience Analysis Matrix:**
    *   Rows for different audiences (Credit Committee, Senior Exec, RM, etc.).
    *   Columns for:
        *   Their Primary Interest/Concern regarding the credit.
        *   Key Information They Need.
        *   Appropriate Level of Detail.
        *   Optimal Tone/Style.
        *   Potential Questions/Objections they might have.
*   **"Pre-Mortem" for Credit Memo Persuasiveness:**
    *   Before submitting, imagine the credit committee *rejects* your recommendation or raises significant unexpected objections. Why might this have happened? What parts of your argument were unclear, unconvincing, or failed to address a key concern? Use this to strengthen the memo.

*(Note: Advanced writing is a skill honed through deliberate practice, seeking and incorporating feedback, and reading widely to observe effective techniques.)*
