    c)  Building a logical, evidence-based argument that leads the reader to a well-reasoned conclusion.
    d)  Exaggerating the strengths and minimizing the weaknesses of a credit.

2.  When crafting a credit narrative for a complex or borderline credit that you are recommending for approval, it is most important to:
    a)  Avoid mentioning significant risks to make the case stronger.
    b)  Focus heavily on the potential upside and high returns for the lender.
    c)  Clearly articulate the major risks and provide robust, credible mitigants for each.
    d)  Use highly technical jargon to demonstrate deep expertise.

    b)  Highly technical, using complex financial terms.
    c)  Concise, strategic, and focused on the most material issues and the overall risk-reward.
    d)  Primarily focused on the history of the bank's relationship with the client.

4.  Using parallel structure in writing (e.g., in bullet points or lists) primarily helps to:
    a)  Make the document longer and appear more thorough.
    b)  Improve readability, clarity, and rhythm.

    c)  Thoroughness, critical thinking, and that you have considered alternative perspectives.

    d)  Potential objections to the claim.

**Part 2: True/False (Indicate whether the statement is True or False)**

7.  True or False: A persuasive credit narrative should always present a one-sided view that strongly advocates for the analyst's recommendation without acknowledging any counterpoints.
8.  True or False: When tailoring communication, the level of technical detail provided to a credit committee should generally be the same as that provided to a relationship manager.
9.  True or False: Using strong, active verbs generally makes writing less impactful and should be avoided in formal credit memos.
