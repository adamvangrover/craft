# Agent Instructions - CRAFT Module 06: Advanced Topics

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this specific module directory.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain CRAFT program style. Content here is "advanced," so ensure depth and precision.
*   **Clarity:** Explain complex topics like QoE, debt restructuring, and intricate legal clauses clearly.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Use Markdown effectively.
*   **Accuracy:** Information must be accurate and reflect current practices where possible (e.g., legal concepts, restructuring trends).
*   **File Naming:** Follow existing conventions (e.g., `12-advanced-financial-statement-analysis-qoe.md`). Note the use of `developer-notes.md` and `teacher-notes.md` files.
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Link to glossaries and other relevant CRAFT/repository sections.
*   **Updating Navigation:**
    *   Module navigation via `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/modules/06-advanced-topics/index.html`. Keep its `filesInDir` and `subDirsInfo` accurate.
    *   Main CRAFT Hub also links here.
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 06 - Advanced Topics

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module (`06-advanced-topics/`) covers:
1.  **Advanced Financial Statement Analysis & Quality of Earnings (QoE)** (Lesson 12)
2.  **Debt Structuring & Restructuring** (Lesson 13)
3.  **Legal Aspects of Credit & Loan Documentation** (Lesson 14)

The main guide is `README.md`. Content is in `12-*.md`, `13-*.md`, `14-*.md` files, including specific `learning-materials.md`, `developer-notes.md`, and `teacher-notes.md` for each lesson. Quizzes are in `quizzes/`.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Rich Content Structure:** This module has a more granular structure with separate files for core content, learning materials, developer notes, and teacher notes for each main lesson. Maintain this structure.
*   **Developer/Teacher Notes:** These files are important.
    *   `developer-notes.md`: For AI or human developers, outlining areas for improvement, specific data sources, or complex logic explanations.
    *   `teacher-notes.md`: For instructors, providing teaching tips, discussion points, or answers to conceptual questions.
*   **Development Focus:** Ensure content is truly "advanced" and builds upon foundational modules. QoE, restructuring, and detailed legal aspects require significant depth.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Advanced FSA/QoE:** Provide practical examples of QoE adjustments. Discuss common red flags in financial statements.
*   **Debt Structuring/Restructuring:** Explain complex debt instruments. Clearly outline the restructuring process (in-court vs. out-of-court) and key considerations like Absolute Priority Rule.
*   **Legal Aspects:** Go beyond basic covenant descriptions. Discuss enforceability, perfection of liens, intercreditor issues, and guarantees in more detail.
*   **Notes Files:** Ensure the `developer-notes.md` and `teacher-notes.md` provide genuinely useful, distinct information for their target audiences.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link heavily to earlier CRAFT modules (e.g., Module 1 for basic FSA, Module 3 for credit memo structure which advanced analysis would feed into).
*   Link to `/Financial_Modeling/` for advanced modeling techniques that might support QoE or restructuring analysis.
*   Link legal concepts to the `Interactive_Notebooks/Legal_Analysis/` notebook.
*   Link to `/Risk_Management/Credit_Risk/` for concepts like problem loan management.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   Interactive case studies for QoE, restructuring, and covenant analysis.
*   Expand learning materials with more external resources.
*   More visual aids for complex structures.

Refer to parent `AGENTS.MD` files for broader CRAFT program and repository guidelines.
