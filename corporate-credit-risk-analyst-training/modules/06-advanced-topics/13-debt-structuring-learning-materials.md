# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 13 - Debt Structuring & Restructuring

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 13)

*   **Debt Structuring:** The process of designing a debt financing package, including determining the mix of debt instruments, maturities, security, covenants, and pricing.
*   **Tranche:** A distinct portion or class of debt within a larger financing package, often with its own specific terms (e.g., seniority, interest rate, maturity).
*   **Credit Spread (Margin):** The amount of interest paid on a loan or bond above a benchmark rate (like SOFR or a government bond yield), compensating lenders/investors for credit risk.
*   **Call Protection (for Bonds):** Provisions that restrict an issuer's ability to redeem bonds before a certain date or require the issuer to pay a premium if bonds are redeemed early. Protects investors from premature refinancing in a lower interest rate environment.
*   **Prepayment Penalty/Premium (for Loans):** A fee a borrower may have to pay if they repay a loan before its scheduled maturity.
*   **Covenant Headroom (Cushion):** The amount of leeway a borrower has before breaching a financial covenant.
*   **Equity Cure Right:** A provision allowing equity holders to contribute additional equity to "cure" a financial covenant breach.
*   **Basket (in Covenants):** Pre-agreed allowances or exceptions within negative covenants that permit a borrower to undertake certain actions (e.g., incur specific amounts of debt, make investments) without explicit lender consent, up to a defined limit.
*   **Builder Basket (Accumulating Basket):** A type of basket, often for restricted payments, where the capacity grows over time based on the company's performance (e.g., a percentage of cumulative net income).
*   **Springing Covenant:** A covenant that only becomes effective if a specific trigger event occurs (e.g., a revolver being drawn beyond a certain threshold).
*   **Portability (of Debt):** Provisions determining if existing debt can remain in place if the company is sold (change of control).
*   **Financial Distress:** A situation where a company is struggling to meet its financial obligations.
*   **Debt Restructuring:** Modifying the terms of existing debt to help a financially distressed company regain viability and avoid bankruptcy.
*   **Workout (Out-of-Court Restructuring):** A negotiated debt restructuring process occurring directly between a company and its creditors, without formal bankruptcy court involvement.
*   **Haircut (on Principal):** In a restructuring, an agreement by creditors to forgive a portion of the principal amount owed by the debtor.
*   **Debt-for-Equity Swap:** An exchange where creditors convert their debt claims into an equity ownership stake in the distressed company.
*   **Debtor-in-Possession (DIP):** In U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the existing management of a company typically continues to operate the business as a DIP.
*   **DIP Financing:** New loans provided to a company already in Chapter 11 bankruptcy to fund its operations during the reorganization. Often has super-priority status.
*   **Automatic Stay:** A legal injunction that halts most creditor actions against a company once it files for bankruptcy (e.g., Chapter 11).
*   **Plan of Reorganization (POR):** A detailed plan proposed in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy outlining how the debtor will reorganize its affairs and how creditor claims will be treated.
*   **Creditors' Committee:** A committee appointed in a bankruptcy case to represent the interests of a particular class of creditors (e.g., Unsecured Creditors' Committee).
*   **Absolute Priority Rule (APR):** A bankruptcy principle (though not always strictly followed in practice) that dictates the order of payment to claimholders, generally requiring senior claims to be paid in full before junior claims receive any recovery, and creditors before equity.
*   **Fulcrum Security:** The class of debt in a restructuring that is expected to be converted into equity of the reorganized company because its claim is not fully covered by the company's value but it is senior enough to receive consideration. Holders of this security often drive negotiations.
*   **Distressed Debt Investing:** Investing in the debt (or equity) of companies that are in or near financial distress, often with the expectation of profiting from a restructuring or turnaround.
*   **Recovery Analysis:** The process of estimating the amount a creditor is likely to recover on their claim in a default or bankruptcy scenario.

## Conceptual Tools & Frameworks (Beyond this Module's Content)

*   **Capitalization Table (Cap Table):** A detailed spreadsheet showing all layers of a company's debt and equity, amounts outstanding, seniority, and key terms. Essential for understanding claim priorities in a restructuring.
*   **Waterfall Analysis (for Recovery):** A model that estimates the distribution of a company's value (going concern or liquidation) to its various claimholders in order of absolute priority in a bankruptcy scenario.
*   **Term Sheet for a Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA):** An outline of key terms agreed upon by a company and its key creditors to support a proposed restructuring plan.
*   **Sources & Uses for DIP Financing:** A table showing where DIP loan proceeds will come from and how they will be used to fund operations during bankruptcy.
*   **Liquidation Analysis:** An analysis comparing the estimated proceeds from selling off a company's assets piecemeal versus the value of the company as a going concern if reorganized. Often required in Chapter 11 to ensure creditors receive at least as much as they would in a Chapter 7 liquidation (Best Interests Test).

*(Note: Debt structuring and restructuring are highly specialized fields often involving complex legal negotiations, valuation disputes, and inter-creditor dynamics.)*
