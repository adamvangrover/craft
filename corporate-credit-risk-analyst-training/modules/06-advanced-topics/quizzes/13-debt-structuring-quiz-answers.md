**Part 1: Multiple Choice**

1.  **Which of the following is primarily an objective for the *borrower* in a debt structuring process?**
    *   **Answer:** c) Achieve the lowest possible cost of debt and maintain operational flexibility.
    *   **Explanation:** Borrowers aim for favorable terms that minimize cost and allow them to run their business with sufficient flexibility. Maximizing collateral (a) and tightest covenants (b) are lender objectives. Shortest tenor (d) is often a lender preference for risk reduction, not necessarily a borrower's primary goal.

2.  **An "equity cure right" in a credit agreement typically allows:**
    *   **Answer:** c) Equity holders (e.g., PE sponsor) to contribute equity to the company to remedy a financial covenant breach.
    *   **Explanation:** This allows shareholders to inject more equity to fix a covenant breach (e.g., by reducing debt or notionally increasing EBITDA for calculation purposes), thus avoiding a default.

3.  **Which of the following is a key advantage of an out-of-court debt restructuring (workout) compared to a formal Chapter 11 bankruptcy?**
    *   **Answer:** c) Generally faster, cheaper, and less disruptive to business operations.
    *   **Explanation:** Out-of-court workouts avoid the administrative costs, publicity, and operational disruptions often associated with formal bankruptcy proceedings. Binding non-consenting creditors (a) and the automatic stay (b) are features of Chapter 11. DIP financing (d) is specific to in-court processes.

4.  **In distressed debt analysis, identifying the "fulcrum security" is important because its holders:**
    *   **Answer:** c) Are often expected to receive equity in the reorganized company and thus may heavily influence the restructuring plan.
    *   **Explanation:** The fulcrum security is the most senior class of debt that is impaired but expected to recover value through receiving equity in the reorganized entity. Their position gives them significant negotiating leverage.

5.  **The "Automatic Stay" in a U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding primarily:**
    *   **Answer:** b) Halts most creditor collection efforts and legal actions against the debtor company.
    *   **Explanation:** The automatic stay provides the debtor with immediate protection from creditors, allowing it time and space to develop a plan of reorganization.

6.  **A "cash flow sweep" mechanism in a loan agreement is designed to:**
    *   **Answer:** c) Require the company to use a portion of its excess cash flow to prepay debt principal.
    *   **Explanation:** This feature helps accelerate de-leveraging by mandating that surplus cash generated by the business is used to pay down debt faster than scheduled.

**Part 2: True/False**

7.  **True or False: In debt structuring, lenders generally prefer bullet maturities over amortizing loans for term debt, as it reduces their interim risk.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** Lenders generally prefer amortizing loans because the periodic principal repayments reduce their outstanding exposure (risk) over the life of the loan, rather than waiting for a single large payment at maturity.

8.  **True or False: "Builder baskets" in negative covenants typically allow a company to make restricted payments or investments based on a fixed dollar amount that never changes.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** While some baskets are fixed, "builder baskets" (or accumulating baskets) typically grow or "build up" based on certain performance metrics like a percentage of cumulative net income, allowing for increased capacity for restricted actions as the company performs well.

9.  **True or False: A primary objective for creditors in a debt restructuring is to ensure the company immediately ceases all operations and liquidates its assets.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** While liquidation is one possible outcome, creditors (especially senior ones) often prefer a restructuring that allows the company to continue as a going concern if they believe this will maximize their recovery value compared to a piecemeal liquidation.

10. **True or False: The "Absolute Priority Rule" in bankruptcy dictates that equity holders must receive a recovery before any debtholders are paid.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** The Absolute Priority Rule (APR) generally dictates the opposite: senior creditors are paid in full before junior creditors, and all creditors must be paid in full before equity holders receive any recovery. Deviations can occur in negotiated plans.

**Part 3: Short Answer**

11. **List three key elements that are considered when structuring a new debt deal, beyond just the interest rate.**
    *   **Answer:** (Any three of the following or similar)
        1.  **Amount and Purpose of Debt**
        2.  **Type of Debt Instrument** (e.g., term loan, revolver, bond)
        3.  **Seniority and Ranking** (e.g., senior secured, unsecured, subordinated)
        4.  **Security/Collateral Package**
        5.  **Tenor/Maturity**
        6.  **Repayment Schedule/Amortization** (including cash sweeps)
        7.  **Covenants** (financial, negative, affirmative)
        8.  **Fees** (upfront, commitment, etc.)

12. **What is the difference between a "maintenance covenant" and an "incurrence covenant" in the context of debt structuring?**
    *   **Answer:**
        *   A **maintenance covenant** requires the borrower to *maintain* a certain financial ratio or condition at all times (tested periodically, usually quarterly). A breach allows lenders to act immediately.
        *   An **incurrence covenant** is tested only when the borrower *takes a specific action* (e.g., incurs more debt, pays a dividend, makes an acquisition). The action is permitted only if the company, on a pro forma basis after the action, would still be in compliance with the specified ratio or condition.

13. **Briefly describe two common methods used in debt restructuring to reduce a company's debt burden.**
    *   **Answer:** (Any two of the following)
        1.  **Debt-for-Equity Swaps:** Creditors exchange some or all of their debt for an equity stake in the company, thereby reducing the company's debt liabilities.
        2.  **Haircuts on Principal:** Creditors agree to forgive a portion of the principal amount owed, directly reducing the debt balance.
        3.  **Extending Maturities/Amending Terms:** While not always reducing the principal, extending maturities and/or temporarily reducing interest rates can alleviate immediate repayment pressure and make the debt more manageable. (Focus on methods that *reduce burden*).

14. **From a creditor's perspective, what is the primary goal of "Recovery Analysis" when analyzing a company in distress?**
    *   **Answer:** The primary goal of recovery analysis is to estimate the amount (e.g., cents on the dollar) that a creditor can reasonably expect to recover on their specific debt claim in various default or restructuring scenarios (e.g., going concern reorganization vs. liquidation). This helps inform investment decisions (for distressed debt investors) or workout strategies (for existing lenders).

15. **What is Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) financing in a Chapter 11 context, and why might a lender be willing to provide it?**
    *   **Answer:** Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) financing is new funding provided to a company after it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to allow it to continue operating during the reorganization process.
        *   A lender might be willing to provide DIP financing because it is often granted **super-priority status** by the bankruptcy court, meaning the DIP lender's claim ranks ahead of most (or all) pre-petition debt and even some administrative expenses, making it a relatively safe loan if the company has sufficient value to support it. DIP loans also typically carry higher interest rates and fees.
