This document provides the answers and brief explanations for the quiz in Module 14.

**Part 1: Multiple Choice**

1.  **Which of the following is typically NOT a Condition Precedent (CP) to the initial funding of a loan?**
    *   **Answer:** d) The borrower achieving its next quarter's projected EBITDA.
    *   **Explanation:** Conditions Precedent are typically about ensuring all legal documentation, authorizations, and required upfront actions (like UCC filings, fee payments) are complete *before* funding. Achieving a future financial projection would be a covenant or ongoing requirement, not a CP to initial funding.

2.  **A "Cross-Default" clause in a loan agreement generally means that:**
    *   **Answer:** b) If the borrower defaults on another material debt obligation, it also triggers a default under this loan agreement.
    *   **Explanation:** This clause protects the lender by allowing them to act if the borrower's overall creditworthiness is impaired by a default on other significant debt, even if payments under *this specific loan* are current.

3.  **The most common method for a lender to "perfect" its security interest in a borrower's accounts receivable and inventory (in the U.S.) is by:**
    *   **Answer:** b) Filing a UCC-1 financing statement with the appropriate Secretary of State.
    *   **Explanation:** For most types of tangible and intangible personal property like A/R and inventory, filing a UCC-1 is the standard method of perfection under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

4.  **An "upstream guarantee" refers to a guarantee provided by:**
    *   **Answer:** b) A subsidiary for the debt of its parent company.
    *   **Explanation:** An upstream guarantee flows "up" the corporate structure from a subsidiary to its parent. These can face scrutiny regarding corporate benefit to the subsidiary.

5.  **An Intercreditor Agreement between First Lien and Second Lien lenders typically defines:**
    *   **Answer:** c) The relative rights and remedies of each lender group regarding shared collateral and bankruptcy proceedings.
    *   **Explanation:** Intercreditor agreements govern issues like lien priority, rights to control foreclosure, distribution of collateral proceeds, payment blockages, and voting in bankruptcy.

6.  **What is the primary purpose of "perfection" of a security interest?**
    *   **Answer:** c) To establish the lender's priority claim on the collateral against third parties, including a bankruptcy trustee.
    *   **Explanation:** Perfection provides public notice of the lender's security interest and establishes its priority relative to other creditors and a bankruptcy trustee. An unperfected security interest may be treated as unsecured in bankruptcy.

**Part 2: True/False**

7.  **True or False: Representations and Warranties in a loan agreement are statements about future performance made by the borrower.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** Reps & Warranties are statements of fact about the borrower's condition, legal status, financials, etc., *as of a specific point in time* (usually the closing date, and sometimes repeated at subsequent borrowings). Future performance is typically addressed by covenants and projections.

8.  **True or False: A "Material Adverse Change" (MAC) clause is always easy for a lender to invoke to avoid funding a loan or to call a default.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** MAC clauses are often heavily negotiated and the threshold for what constitutes a "material adverse change" can be high and subject to legal interpretation. Invoking them can be challenging unless the change is demonstrably severe and durable.

9.  **True or False: A guarantee is only as valuable as the guarantor's financial capacity to actually pay if called upon.**
    *   **Answer:** True
    *   **Explanation:** A guarantee from an insolvent or financially weak entity provides little actual credit enhancement. The guarantor's ability to pay is paramount.

10. **True or False: Under UCC Article 9 in the U.S., a security agreement must always be filed with a government office to be valid against the borrower.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** A security agreement creates the security interest between the debtor (borrower) and the secured party (lender) and is generally enforceable between those two parties upon attachment (which requires value given, debtor rights in collateral, and an authenticated security agreement). Filing (perfection) is required to make it effective against *third parties*.

**Part 3: Short Answer**

11. **List three common Events of Default (EoDs) found in a typical loan agreement, other than non-payment of principal or interest.**
    *   **Answer:** (Any three of the following or similar)
        1.  Breach of a covenant (financial, negative, or affirmative).
        2.  Incorrectness of a Representation or Warranty in a material respect.
        3.  Cross-Default or Cross-Acceleration to other material indebtedness.
        4.  Bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.
        5.  Material judgments against the borrower that are not paid or stayed.
        6.  Change of Control (if defined as an EoD).

12. **What is a "Deposit Account Control Agreement" (DACA) and why would a lender require one?**
    *   **Answer:** A DACA is a three-party agreement between a lender (secured party), a borrower (debtor), and the bank where the borrower maintains its deposit account(s).
        *   A lender would require one to perfect its security interest in the borrower's deposit accounts. By obtaining "control" through the DACA, the lender ensures its priority claim over those cash balances and can direct the depository bank to remit funds to the lender upon a default.

13. **Why might an "upstream" guarantee from a subsidiary for its parent's debt face potential fraudulent conveyance challenges in a bankruptcy?**
    *   **Answer:** An upstream guarantee can be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance if the subsidiary providing the guarantee did not receive "reasonably equivalent value" or fair consideration in exchange for taking on the liability of its parent's debt. If the subsidiary was insolvent at the time, or rendered insolvent by the guarantee, and didn't receive adequate benefit, a bankruptcy trustee or other creditors could seek to void the guarantee, arguing it was detrimental to the subsidiary's own creditors.

14. **Briefly describe two key issues typically addressed in a subordination agreement.**
    *   **Answer:** (Any two of the following)
        1.  **Payment Subordination:** Defines whether/when the subordinated creditor can receive principal and/or interest payments (e.g., payments may be blocked if a senior default occurs or if certain conditions aren't met).
        2.  **Lien Subordination (if applicable):** Specifies that the subordinated creditor's lien on shared collateral is junior to the senior creditor's lien.
        3.  **Remedy Standstill / Enforcement Blockage:** Restricts the subordinated creditor's ability to exercise remedies (like suing or foreclosing) against the borrower for a certain period if the senior debt is in default.
        4.  **Turnover Provision:** Requires the subordinated creditor to turn over any payments received in violation of the subordination terms to the senior creditor.

15. **If a borrower defaults on a secured loan, list two common remedies available to the lender.**
    *   **Answer:** (Any two of the following)
        1.  **Acceleration of the Debt:** Declare the entire outstanding loan balance immediately due and payable.
        2.  **Foreclosure/Repossession and Sale of Collateral:** Seize and sell the assets pledged as security to recover the amounts owed.
        3.  **Setoff:** Apply funds held in the borrower's deposit accounts with the lender against the defaulted debt.
        4.  **Sue the Borrower and/or Guarantors:** Obtain a judgment for the amounts owed.
