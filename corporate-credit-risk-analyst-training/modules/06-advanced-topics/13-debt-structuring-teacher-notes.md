# Teacher Notes: Module 13 - Debt Structuring & Restructuring

## Module Learning Objectives for Instructor Focus:

*   Students should understand the **key objectives and elements involved in structuring new debt facilities** from both the borrower's and lender's perspectives.
*   Appreciate the **nuances of advanced covenant considerations**, including EBITDA definitions, headroom, equity cures, baskets, and springing covenants.
*   Define **debt restructuring** and identify common triggers and objectives for both the distressed company and its creditors.
*   Differentiate between **out-of-court workouts and in-court (Chapter 11) restructurings**, understanding the pros and cons of each.
*   Introduce the **core focus areas of distressed debt analysis** from a creditor's viewpoint, emphasizing recovery analysis and legal rights.
*   Provide a **high-level overview of the U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy process**, including key concepts like the automatic stay, DIP financing, Plan of Reorganization, and the Absolute Priority Rule.

## Key Concepts to Emphasize:

*   **Balancing Act in Structuring:** Meeting borrower needs while protecting lender interests. Market conditions play a huge role.
*   **Covenants as Negotiated Protections:** They are not boilerplate; definitions and specific terms (like baskets) matter immensely.
*   **Restructuring as a Value Maximization Exercise (Ideally):** For creditors, the goal is often to recover more than in a liquidation, which may mean supporting a reorganization.
*   **Chapter 11 as a Legal Framework:** It provides tools and a process for complex reorganizations, including binding dissenting creditors.
*   **Absolute Priority Rule (APR) vs. Reality:** APR is the theoretical underpinning, but negotiated plans often involve deviations.
*   **Fulcrum Security:** Understanding which creditor class is likely to get equity is key to understanding negotiation dynamics in Chapter 11.
*   **Recovery, Recovery, Recovery:** The ultimate concern for any creditor of a distressed company.

## Potential Discussion Questions & Activities:

1.  **Structuring Trade-offs:** "A high-growth, pre-profitability tech company needs funding. What kind of debt structure might be appropriate, if any? What non-traditional terms or lender protections might be sought?" (Discuss venture debt, convertible notes, revenue-based financing as alternatives or complements to traditional bank debt).
2.  **EBITDA Definition Game:** "Why would a PE sponsor want to include 'projected cost savings not yet realized' or 'losses from a discontinued operation' as add-backs to EBITDA in a credit agreement? Why would a lender resist these?"
3.  **Workout vs. Bankruptcy Decision:** "A company has breached covenants and is running out of cash. It has 10 bank lenders. What factors would make an out-of-court workout more likely to succeed? What factors might push it towards a Chapter 11 filing?" (Consider number of creditors, complexity of capital structure, willingness of parties to negotiate).
4.  **Distressed Investor Thesis:** "A company's senior unsecured bonds are trading at 40 cents on the dollar. What might a distressed debt investor be thinking if they decide to buy these bonds? What key pieces of analysis would they undertake?" (Focus on recovery scenarios, potential for fulcrum security status).
5.  **APR Violation Debate:** "Why might senior creditors sometimes agree to a Chapter 11 plan that gives some value to junior creditors or even old equity, even if the senior creditors are not being paid in full (a violation of strict APR)?" (Consider need for consensus, speed, avoiding litigation, new value contributions).
6.  **DIP Financing Rationale:** "Why is DIP financing often considered very safe for the DIP lender, even though the company is bankrupt?" (Super-priority status, often secured by unencumbered assets).

## Common Student Misconceptions/Challenges:

*   **Debt Structuring as One-Size-Fits-All:** Not appreciating how tailored structures are to specific borrower needs, risks, and market conditions.
*   **Believing Covenants are Static:** Not understanding the negotiation around definitions, baskets, and cure rights.
*   **Viewing Bankruptcy Only as Liquidation:** Not understanding Chapter 11 as a reorganization tool.
*   **Complexity of Legal Processes:** Chapter 11 is intricate; this module provides only a high-level overview.
*   **Emotional Aspect of Distress:** The human element of companies in trouble, job losses, etc., which is real but analytically secondary to creditor rights and recoveries.

## Activity Ideas:

*   **Mock Term Sheet Negotiation:** Provide a simplified term sheet for a loan with a few key contentious points (e.g., EBITDA definition, covenant levels, basket sizes). Divide students into "Borrower" and "Lender" teams to briefly negotiate.
*   **Capital Structure Waterfall Exercise (Simple):** Given a company's liquidation value and a simplified capital structure (Senior Secured, Senior Unsecured, Subordinated, Equity), have students determine how proceeds would be distributed and who gets impaired.
*   **Analyze a News Article on a Recent Restructuring:** Find an article about a company going through Chapter 11 or a major out-of-court workout. Have students identify key creditor classes, proposed treatments, and potential issues.
*   **"What Kind of Debt?" Scenario:** Describe a company's funding need (e.g., funding a large acquisition, short-term working capital, financing a new factory). Ask students to suggest the most appropriate type(s) of debt and key structuring considerations.

## Instructor Notes for Delivery:

*   **Use Real-World Examples:** Discussing well-known bankruptcies (e.g., Lehman Brothers, GM, recent retail bankruptcies) or restructurings can make concepts more vivid.
*   **Legal Nuances:** Acknowledge that this is a high-level overview and that actual debt structuring and restructuring involve significant legal expertise.
*   **Interplay of Parties:** Emphasize the negotiation dynamics between the company, different creditor groups (often with conflicting interests), and equity holders in a distress situation.
*   **Valuation is Key (in Distress):** While detailed valuation is beyond this module, stress that company valuation (going concern vs. liquidation) is a central point of contention and driver of outcomes in restructuring.
*   **Connect to Previous Modules:** Covenant understanding (Module 3), LBO/M&A leverage (Module 9), and ongoing monitoring (Module 10) all lead into why restructurings happen.
