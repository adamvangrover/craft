# Module 5: Business Writing & Grammar for Credit Professionals

## 5.1. The Credit Memorandum: Purpose, Structure, and Best Practices
The culmination of an analyst's work on a new credit or a portfolio review is the credit memorandum (or credit memo/report). This document is the primary vehicle for communicating the analysis and making a formal recommendation to the credit committee or decision-makers. It is not merely a summary of facts; it is a persuasive document designed to lead the reader to a logical, well-supported conclusion.

An effective credit memo is clear, concise, and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the borrower and the associated risks. While templates may vary by institution, a standard credit memo structure generally includes the following components:
*   **Executive Summary & Recommendation:** This is the most important section, as some senior readers may not go further. It should be no longer than one page and must state the recommendation upfront (e.g., "Approve," "Decline," "Approve with modifications"). It should also summarize the borrower, the proposed transaction, the key credit strengths, and the most significant risks along with their corresponding mitigants.
*   **Borrower and Management Overview:** A description of the company's business, its history, its products or services, and an assessment of the management team's experience and track record.
*   **Industry Analysis:** A summary of the key industry dynamics, competitive landscape (often using a framework like Porter's Five Forces), and the borrower's position within the industry.
*   **Financial Analysis:** A detailed analysis of the borrower's historical and projected financial performance. This section includes a discussion of key financial ratios (leverage, coverage, liquidity, profitability) and an analysis of the financial model's base case, downside, and stress-test scenarios.
*   **Sources of Repayment:** A critical section that outlines the primary, secondary, and tertiary ways the lender expects to be repaid.
    *   Primary Source: Cash flow from operations. The analysis must demonstrate that the business can generate sufficient cash to service its debt.
    *   Secondary Source: The sale of collateral. This requires an analysis of the value and liquidity of the assets pledged to secure the loan.
    *   Tertiary Source: Support from a guarantor or the proceeds from an equity injection.
*   **Conclusion and Proposed Covenants:** A final reiteration of the recommendation, supported by the detailed analysis. This section also outlines the specific loan covenants that are being proposed as part of the credit agreement to mitigate identified risks.

Best practices for writing a credit memo include knowing the audience (senior decision-makers with limited time), prioritizing the most material information, and ensuring the narrative flows logically from analysis to conclusion.

## 5.2. Writing with Clarity, Conciseness, and Conviction
The quality of the writing in a credit memo directly reflects on the quality of the analysis. Poorly written, confusing, or overly long memos can obscure good analysis and undermine the analyst's credibility. Effective business writing in a credit context adheres to several key principles:
*   **Be Direct and Get to the Point:** Use the "inverted pyramid" style of writing. State the conclusion or main point first, then provide the supporting details. The executive summary is the prime example of this.
*   **Use Active Voice:** Active voice ("The company increased its revenue") is more direct and powerful than passive voice ("Revenue was increased by the company").
*   **Be Specific and Data-Driven:** Every assertion should be backed by evidence. Instead of saying "The company has high leverage," say "The company's Total Debt/EBITDA stands at 6.5x, which is above the industry average of 4.0x."
*   **Avoid Jargon and Ambiguity:** Write in clear, plain language. While technical terms are necessary, they should be used precisely and explained if the audience might be unfamiliar with them.
*   **Structure for Readability:** Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet points to break up text and make the document easy to scan.

## 5.3. Grammar and Style for Financial Professionals
Maintaining a high standard of grammar and style is a matter of professionalism. Errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation can distract the reader and create an impression of carelessness, which is the antithesis of what a credit analyst should project. This section of the course would include a review of common mistakes, such as subject-verb agreement, proper use of commas, and consistency in formatting and terminology. The goal is to produce documents that are not only analytically sound but also polished and professional.
