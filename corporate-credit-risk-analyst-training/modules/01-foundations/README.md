# Module 1: Foundations - Accounting, Financial Statements, and Basic Modeling

Welcome to Module 1 of the Corporate Credit Risk Analyst Foundations Training (CRAFT) program. This foundational module is designed to equip you with the essential building blocks for understanding and analyzing corporate credit risk. We will delve into the language of business—accounting—and introduce the core techniques for financial analysis and modeling.

## Key Learning Areas in This Module:

This module is broadly divided into two core areas:

### 1. Accounting and Financial Statement Analysis
Understanding how companies record their financial activities and report their financial health is paramount for any credit analyst. This section covers:
*   **Core Accounting Principles:** We explore fundamental concepts like GAAP vs. IFRS, the principle of conservatism (prudence), the accrual method, and why these standards are critical for transparency and comparability.
*   **Deconstructing the Three Financial Statements:** A detailed look at the Balance Sheet (what a company owns and owes at a point in time), the Income Statement (its performance over a period), and the Statement of Cash Flows (the actual movement of cash).
*   **The Interconnectivity of Financial Statements:** Crucially, we examine how these three statements are linked. Understanding this interconnectedness is vital for building financial models and identifying red flags (e.g., divergence between net income and cash flow from operations).
*   **Deep Dive into Revenue Recognition (ASC 606) and Expense Analysis:** Understanding how revenue is booked and how expenses are categorized provides insight into a company's operational efficiency and earnings quality.
*   **The Importance of Footnotes (Notes to the Financial Statements):** Learning to read and interpret footnotes to uncover significant accounting policies, debt details, commitments, contingencies, and other hidden risks.

### 2. Financial Analysis and Modeling Techniques
Once you understand the financial statements, the next step is to analyze them effectively and build predictive models. This section introduces:
*   **Building the 3-Statement Financial Model:** Best practices for constructing an integrated model that links the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. This includes structure, layout, color-coding, and the importance of supporting schedules (debt, PP&E, working capital).
*   **Forecasting with Purpose:** Principles for developing well-reasoned assumptions to project a company's future financial performance. This covers the typical order of operations: forecasting the Income Statement, then the Balance Sheet, then the Cash Flow Statement, and finally "plugging" to balance the model.
*   **The Analyst's Core Toolkit - Key Credit Ratios:** An introduction to the essential financial ratios used by credit analysts to assess a company's leverage, coverage, liquidity, and profitability. Understanding these ratios is fundamental to quantifying credit risk.
*   **Beyond the Base Case - Advanced Analysis:** An overview of sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and stress testing, which are techniques used to evaluate a company's resilience under various conditions.

**Key Lessons & Materials:**
*   `02-financial-analysis-and-modeling.md`: Core concepts and explanations.
