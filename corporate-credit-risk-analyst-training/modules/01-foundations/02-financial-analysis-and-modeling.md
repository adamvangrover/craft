# Module 2: Financial Analysis & Modeling

## 2.1. Building the 3-Statement Financial Model
A financial model is a spreadsheet-based tool, typically built in Microsoft Excel, that forecasts a company's financial performance into the future. For a credit analyst, the **3-statement model** is the cornerstone of quantitative analysis. It integrates the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, ensuring all three are consistent and dynamically linked. This allows the analyst to test assumptions, project a company's ability to service its debt, and assess its overall financial health under various conditions.

Building a robust, flexible, and auditable model requires a disciplined, structured approach. The process begins with establishing a standardized format to ensure clarity, accuracy, and ease of use.

**Best Practices in Financial Modeling:**
*   **Clear Structure & Layout:**
    *   **Dedicated Input Sheet(s):** All key assumptions and drivers (e.g., revenue growth rates, margin assumptions, interest rates, tax rates) should be centralized in one or more clearly labeled input sheets. This makes it easy to change assumptions and see their impact throughout the model. Avoid hard-coding assumptions directly into formulas on the financial statement sheets.
    *   **Historical Data Section:** Clearly separate historical financial data from projected data.
    *   **Logical Flow:** Organize sheets logically (e.g., Inputs, Historicals, Projections_IS, Projections_BS, Projections_CFS, Supporting_Schedules, Ratios, Sensitivities).
    *   **Consistency:** Use consistent formatting for headings, numbers, and labels.
*   **Color-Coding:** Differentiate inputs from calculations to enhance transparency and auditability. A common convention:
    *   **Blue font:** Hard-coded inputs or assumptions.
    *   **Black font:** Formulas and calculations (outputs derived from other cells).
    *   **Green font (optional):** Formulas linking to other worksheets.
*   **Periodicity:** Decide on the model's time frame.
    *   **Annual models:** Common for long-term valuation and strategic planning.
    *   **Quarterly models:** Often preferred in credit analysis for tracking near-term performance, covenant compliance, and liquidity, especially for leveraged or distressed companies. Monthly models might be used for highly distressed situations or detailed cash flow forecasting.
*   **Explicit Formulas:** Write formulas that are easy to understand and trace. Avoid overly complex, nested formulas if simpler steps can achieve the same result. Use named ranges where appropriate to improve readability.
*   **Checks and Balances:** Include error checks throughout the model. The most fundamental is the balance sheet check (Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity). Other checks might include ensuring the cash flow statement correctly reconciles beginning and ending cash balances.

**Populating Historical Data:**
The first step in building the model is to populate it with historical financial data. An analyst should typically input at least three to five years of financial data from the company's public filings (e.g., 10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports) or private financial statements. This historical analysis is crucial for:
*   Understanding past performance, growth trends, and profitability.
*   Calculating historical ratios to establish a baseline.
*   Identifying seasonality or cyclicality in the business.
*   Informing the assumptions for the forecast period.

**Supporting Schedules: The Engine Room**
With the historical data in place, the next step is to create the supporting schedules that will drive many of the projections. These schedules break down complex items into more manageable components:
*   **Revenue Schedule:** May break down revenue by segment, product, geography, or key customers, with specific drivers for each (e.g., volume, price).
*   **Debt & Interest Schedule:** Tracks the beginning and ending balances of each debt tranche (e.g., revolver, term loan A, term loan B, bonds). It calculates scheduled principal repayments (amortization), mandatory prepayments (e.g., from cash sweeps), optional prepayments, and interest expense (cash and PIK) based on outstanding debt balances and respective interest rates. This schedule is critical for credit analysis.
*   **Fixed Asset (PP&E) Schedule:** Starts with the beginning PP&E balance, adds capital expenditures (CapEx), and subtracts depreciation expense to arrive at the ending PP&E balance. This schedule also often projects future CapEx and depreciation.
*   **Working Capital Schedule:** Forecasts key operational balance sheet accounts like accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. These are often projected based on activity ratios or turnover day assumptions (e.g., Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) for A/R, Days Inventory Held (DIH) for Inventory, Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for A/P).
    *   *Example:* Accounts Receivable = (DSO / Days in Period) * Revenue
*   **Equity Schedule:** Tracks changes in equity accounts, including common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings (linking to net income and dividends), and other comprehensive income.
*   **Tax Schedule:** Calculates current and deferred income taxes, taking into account net operating losses (NOLs) if applicable.

## 2.2. Forecasting with Purpose
The forecast is the heart of the model, and its reliability hinges on the quality of its underlying assumptions. Assumptions for key drivers should be well-reasoned, defensible, and clearly documented, based on a combination of:
*   **Historical trends:** Extrapolating past performance, but with caution.
*   **Management guidance:** Company forecasts and expectations (often taken with a degree of skepticism).
*   **Industry analysis:** Growth rates, competitive pressures, and outlook for the sector.
*   **Economic outlook:** Macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates.
*   **Analyst's own judgment:** Based on research and understanding of the company.

**The Forecasting Process (Order of Operations):**
1.  **Forecast the Income Statement:**
    *   **Revenue:** Often the most important driver. Project revenue growth based on detailed assumptions (e.g., volume growth x price increases). *Example: Year 1 Revenue = Prior Year Revenue * (1 + Assumed Growth Rate).*
    *   **COGS:** Typically projected as a percentage of revenue (Gross Margin assumption) or based on specific input cost forecasts.
    *   **Operating Expenses (SG&A, R&D):** Often projected as a percentage of revenue, or grown at a specific rate (e.g., inflation), or based on specific company plans (e.g., new hiring, marketing campaigns).
    *   **Depreciation & Amortization:** Usually linked from the PP&E and Intangible Asset schedules.
    *   **Interest Expense/Income:** Linked from the Debt schedule and cash balances.
    *   **Taxes:** Calculated based on pre-tax income and an assumed tax rate (from Tax schedule).
    *   This flows down to a projected Net Income.

2.  **Forecast the Balance Sheet (excluding cash and debt that acts as a plug):**
    *   Project balance sheet accounts that are driven by operations and investment activities, often linking to the Income Statement or supporting schedules.
    *   **Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Accounts Payable:** Linked from the Working Capital schedule (e.g., based on DSO, DIH, DPO assumptions and revenue/COGS).
    *   **PP&E:** Linked from the Fixed Asset schedule (Ending PP&E = Beginning PP&E + CapEx - Depreciation).
    *   **Goodwill & Intangibles:** Typically remain constant unless acquisitions or impairments are modeled.
    *   **Other Assets/Liabilities:** Projected based on historical trends or specific assumptions.
    *   **Shareholders' Equity Accounts (excluding Retained Earnings roll-forward):** Common stock and APIC may remain constant unless equity issuance or buybacks are modeled.
    *   **Retained Earnings:** Calculated as Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends Paid.

3.  **Forecast the Cash Flow Statement:** The CFS is largely a reconciliation and is therefore derived from the forecasted Income Statement and the changes in the forecasted Balance Sheet accounts.
    *   **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO):** Starts with Net Income, adds back non-cash charges (like D&A), and adjusts for changes in working capital accounts (linking to the changes in A/R, Inventory, A/P, etc., on the Balance Sheet).
    *   **Cash Flow from Investing (CFI):** Primarily driven by CapEx (from the PP&E schedule) and any modeled acquisitions or divestitures.
    *   **Cash Flow from Financing (CFF):** Includes changes in debt (new borrowings, repayments â€“ linked from Debt schedule), changes in equity (stock issuance/repurchases), and dividends paid (linked from Retained Earnings calculation).

4.  **Balance the Model (The "Plug"):** The final, crucial step is to ensure the model "balances" (i.e., Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity). This is achieved by linking the **Ending Cash Balance** from the CFS to the **Cash and Cash Equivalents** account on the Balance Sheet.
    *   The model calculates a preliminary ending cash balance based on CFO, CFI, and CFF (excluding any new debt/equity raised to meet a cash shortfall or debt paid down with excess cash).
    *   If this results in a cash deficit, a "plug" item, typically a revolving credit facility (Revolver) or new debt issuance, is used to bring the cash balance to a minimum required level.
    *   If there's excess cash, this might be used to pay down the Revolver or other debt (a "cash sweep"), or it simply accumulates on the balance sheet.
    *   **Circular References ("Circs"):** A common issue arises because interest expense (on the Income Statement) depends on the average debt balance, but the debt balance (on the Balance Sheet) can depend on the cash flow available for debt repayment, which is affected by net income (after interest expense). This creates a circular reference.
        *   **Excel's Iteration Feature:** Can be enabled (File > Options > Formulas > Enable iterative calculation) to resolve circs, but use with caution as it can mask errors if not built correctly.
        *   **Manual "Plug" or Toggles:** Some modelers use a manual switch or a simplified approach to avoid iteration, especially in initial learning stages.
        *   **Copy-Paste Values:** For complex circs, sometimes a section is calculated, values are copy-pasted, and then the model recalculates. (Less ideal for dynamic models).
        *   **Error Check:** Always have a "Balance Check" cell (Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Equity) that should be zero (or very close due to rounding).

## 2.3. The Analyst's Core Toolkit: Key Credit Ratios
With a fully integrated and balanced model, the analyst can now calculate the key financial ratios that are the lifeblood of credit analysis. These ratios standardize financial data, allowing for comparison over time (trend analysis) and against industry peers (peer analysis), and provide a quantitative assessment of a company's creditworthiness. They fall into four main categories. Lenders focus on these ratios to gauge risk and repayment ability.

*   **Leverage Ratios:** Measure the extent to which a company relies on debt to finance its assets. Higher leverage generally implies higher financial risk, as the company has larger fixed debt service obligations.
    *   **Total Debt / EBITDA:** The most common leverage ratio in credit analysis. It indicates approximately how many years of operating cash flow (before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) it would take to repay all debt.
        *   *Lender Implication:* A lower ratio is better. A ratio of 3.0x might be considered low leverage, while 6.0x+ could be high leverage, depending heavily on the industry's stability and asset intensity. Highly leveraged companies have less room for error if EBITDA declines.
    *   **Net Debt / EBITDA:** Similar to Total Debt/EBITDA, but uses Net Debt (Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents). This gives credit for cash on hand that could theoretically be used to repay debt.
    *   **Debt / Capital (Total Debt / (Total Debt + Total Equity)):** Measures debt as a percentage of the company's total capital base. It provides insight into the company's capital structure and reliance on creditors versus owners.
        *   *Lender Implication:* A company with 70% Debt/Capital is significantly more reliant on lenders than one with 30%.
    *   **Debt / Equity:** Compares total debt to shareholders' equity. A high ratio indicates that the company is financed more by creditors than by its owners, meaning creditors bear more risk.

*   **Coverage Ratios:** Measure a company's ability to meet (i.e., "cover") its debt-related obligations from its operating cash flow. They are a direct measure of repayment capacity and the cushion available to absorb a decline in earnings.
    *   **Interest Coverage Ratio (EBIT / Interest Expense or EBITDA / Interest Expense):** Also known as Times Interest Earned (TIE). Measures how many times a company's operating income (or EBITDA) can cover its interest expense.
        *   *Lender Implication:* A higher ratio is better. A ratio below 1.5x-2.0x is often a red flag, indicating difficulty servicing interest payments if earnings decline.
    *   **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** A broader measure that assesses the ability to cover both interest and scheduled principal payments (debt service). The formula can vary, but a common one is (Net Operating Income or EBITDA) / (Total Debt Service = Principal + Interest).
        *   *Lender Implication:* A ratio below 1.0x means the company is not generating enough cash from operations to meet its current debt obligations, requiring refinancing or asset sales. Lenders typically want to see DSCRs comfortably above 1.25x or 1.5x.
    *   **Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR):** Often considered the most comprehensive coverage ratio for credit analysis. It typically includes other "fixed" charges like operating lease payments or preferred dividends in the denominator. A common formula: (EBITDA - Unfunded CapEx - Cash Taxes) / (Cash Interest + Scheduled Principal Repayments + Operating Lease Payments).
        *   *Lender Implication:* Provides a robust view of cash available for all unavoidable fixed outlays.

*   **Liquidity Ratios:** Measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations (those due within one year) with its short-term assets. Poor liquidity can lead to a financial crisis even for a profitable company if it cannot pay its bills as they come due.
    *   **Current Ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities):** The most basic liquidity measure.
        *   *Lender Implication:* A ratio above 1.0 is generally necessary. Creditors typically prefer to see ratios of 1.5x to 2.0 or higher, indicating more liquid assets to cover short-term debts.
    *   **Quick Ratio ((Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities):** Also called the "acid-test" ratio. This is a stricter measure that excludes inventory (which may not be easily or quickly converted to cash without a significant discount) and sometimes prepaid expenses.
        *   *Lender Implication:* A Quick Ratio above 1.0x provides greater comfort that readily convertible assets can cover immediate liabilities.

*   **Profitability Ratios:** Measure a company's ability to generate profits from its sales and assets. While credit analysis is primarily downside-focused, a consistently profitable business with strong margins is fundamentally a better credit risk as it generates cash to service debt and reinvest in the business.
    *   **Gross Profit Margin (Gross Profit / Revenue):** Shows the percentage of revenue remaining after COGS. Indicates pricing power and production efficiency.
    *   **Operating Profit Margin (Operating Income (EBIT) / Revenue):** Shows profitability from core business operations before interest and taxes.
    *   **Net Profit Margin (Net Income / Revenue):** The percentage of revenue remaining as profit after all expenses, including interest and taxes.
    *   **Return on Assets (ROA) (Net Income / Average Total Assets):** Measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profit.
    *   **Return on Equity (ROE) (Net Income / Average Total Equity):** Measures the rate of return generated on the money invested by shareholders. While important for equity investors, for creditors, a very high ROE driven by high leverage can be a sign of increased risk.

*(Note: Specific ratio definitions and "acceptable" levels can vary by institution, industry, and the specifics of the credit.)*

## 2.4. Beyond the Base Case: Advanced Analysis
A static, base-case model is insufficient for true risk analysis. The analyst must test the model's resilience to changes in key assumptions using a tiered system of advanced techniques. This progression allows the analyst to move from identifying specific sensitivities to understanding plausible business scenarios and finally to assessing the impact of severe, systemic shocks.

*   First, **Sensitivity Analysis**, also known as "what-if" analysis, is used to determine how changes in a *single* independent variable (assumption) affect key dependent variables (outputs like Net Income, EBITDA, key ratios, or debt repayment capacity).
    *   *Examples:*
        *   How does a 1% decrease in revenue growth impact the Interest Coverage Ratio?
        *   What is the impact on Free Cash Flow if COGS as a % of revenue increases by 200 basis points?
        *   How much does EBITDA change if a key input cost rises by 10%?
    *   This technique is invaluable for identifying the model's most critical assumptions â€“ the variables that cause the largest swings in credit metrics are the ones that warrant the most scrutiny during due diligence and ongoing monitoring.
    *   Visual tools like **Tornado Diagrams** or simple data tables can effectively display which variables have the most significant impact on an output.

*   Second, **Scenario Analysis** builds on this by changing *multiple* input variables simultaneously to model a specific, plausible future state or narrative. Rather than asking "what if interest rates go up by 1%?", scenario analysis asks "what if we enter a mild recession?". This would involve modeling a combination of:
    *   Lower revenue growth (e.g., -5% instead of +5%).
    *   Compressed margins (e.g., Gross Margin down 2%, SG&A up 1% as % of revenue).
    *   Potentially higher interest rates or reduced credit availability.
    *   Analysts typically build a:
        *   **Base Case:** The most likely expected outcome, based on current trends and reasonable assumptions.
        *   **Upside Case (or Best Case):** More optimistic assumptions (e.g., stronger growth, margin improvement). Useful for understanding potential but less about downside risk.
        *   **Downside Case (or Worst Case/Stress Case):** More pessimistic assumptions, reflecting potential adverse events or economic conditions. This is critical for credit analysis to understand repayment capacity under pressure and potential covenant breaches.
    *   This transforms the analysis from an abstract sensitivity test into a concrete business narrative about how the company might perform under different, but plausible, future conditions.

*   Finally, **Stress Testing** is a specialized and more extreme form of scenario analysis. It is used to gauge the potential impact of a *severe but plausible* crisis where normal market conditions and correlations might break down. These scenarios are often more extreme than typical downside cases and may be mandated by regulators (like the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR/DFAST stress tests for large banks) or internal risk policies.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   A severe global recession (e.g., GDP decline of 5%, unemployment doubles).
        *   A sharp drop in asset prices or a commodity price shock relevant to the borrower.
        *   A major liquidity freeze in financial markets.
        *   Loss of a major customer representing 40% of revenue.
    *   While scenario analysis might model a mild recession, a stress test would model a deep and prolonged one. It is a fundamental tool for assessing capital adequacy, understanding the vulnerabilities of a portfolio at the "tail" of the loss distribution, and answering the question: "What happens in a truly bad, but still conceivable, outcome, and can the borrower survive?"
