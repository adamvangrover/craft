**Part 1: Multiple Choice**

1.  **What is the primary objective of building a 3-statement financial model for a credit analyst?**
    *   **Answer:** b) To assess the company's ability to service its debt and understand its financial health under various scenarios.
    *   **Explanation:** While a model might be used in valuation, for a credit analyst, the core purpose is to analyze debt repayment capacity, covenant compliance, and overall financial stability under different operating assumptions.

2.  **Which of the following is a common best practice in financial modeling for differentiating hard-coded inputs from formulas?**
    *   **Answer:** c) Using blue font for inputs and black font for formulas.
    *   **Explanation:** This color-coding convention is widely adopted to make models more transparent and easier to audit by clearly distinguishing between direct inputs (assumptions) and calculated outputs.

3.  **A "circular reference" in an Excel model most commonly occurs in a 3-statement model because:**
    *   **Answer:** b) Interest expense affects net income, which affects cash flow, which can affect the debt balance that determines interest expense.
    *   **Explanation:** This interdependency is the classic cause of circularity: Interest is calculated on debt, but debt levels (especially if a revolver or cash sweep is modeled) can change based on cash flow, which itself is reduced by interest expense.

4.  **If a company's Total Debt / EBITDA ratio increases from 3.0x to 5.0x, it generally signifies:**
    *   **Answer:** c) Increased financial risk and higher leverage.
    *   **Explanation:** A higher Debt/EBITDA ratio means the company has more debt relative to its operating cash flow (as approximated by EBITDA), indicating it would take more years of current cash flow to repay debt. This is a key indicator of increased financial risk.

5.  **Which type of analysis typically involves changing multiple input variables simultaneously to model a specific, plausible future state (e.g., a "recession case")?**
    *   **Answer:** c) Scenario Analysis
    *   **Explanation:** Scenario analysis involves creating different coherent sets of assumptions (e.g., base case, upside case, downside/recession case) to see how the company performs under varying, but internally consistent, future conditions.

6.  **The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR) is often considered more comprehensive than the Interest Coverage Ratio (TIE) for credit analysis because:**
    *   **Answer:** c) It typically includes other fixed charges like scheduled principal repayments and sometimes lease payments in its calculation.
    *   **Explanation:** FCCR aims to measure the ability to cover *all* mandatory fixed obligations (interest, principal, leases), not just interest, providing a more complete picture of cash flow available for fixed commitments.

**Part 2: True/False**

7.  **True or False: In a 3-statement model, the Cash Flow Statement is typically forecasted directly by projecting individual cash inflows and outflows.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** While a direct cash flow forecast is possible, in an integrated 3-statement model, the Cash Flow Statement is usually derived from the forecasted Income Statement and the changes in the Balance Sheet accounts.

8.  **True or False: Supporting schedules, such as a Debt Schedule or PP&E Schedule, are used to keep the main financial statements cleaner and make complex calculations more transparent.**
    *   **Answer:** True
    *   **Explanation:** Supporting schedules house detailed calculations for items like debt amortization, interest expense, PP&E roll-forwards, etc., which prevents the main IS, BS, and CFS from becoming overly cluttered and complex.

9.  **True or False: A Current Ratio of 0.8x indicates strong short-term liquidity for a company.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** A Current Ratio below 1.0x (like 0.8x) indicates that current liabilities exceed current assets, suggesting potential difficulty in meeting short-term obligations. Generally, a ratio above 1.5x-2.0x is preferred.

10. **True or False: Stress Testing involves analyzing the impact of a small change in a single key assumption on a model output.**
    *   **Answer:** False
    *   **Explanation:** This describes Sensitivity Analysis. Stress Testing involves analyzing the impact of *severe but plausible crisis scenarios*, often involving multiple adverse changes, to assess resilience under extreme conditions.

**Part 3: Short Answer**

11. **List the four main categories of financial ratios used in credit analysis, as discussed in the module.**
    *   **Answer:**
        1.  Leverage Ratios
        2.  Coverage Ratios
        3.  Liquidity Ratios
        4.  Profitability Ratios

12. **Explain the purpose of a "Debt Schedule" in a 3-statement financial model. What key information does it typically track and calculate?**
    *   **Answer:** The purpose of a Debt Schedule is to model a company's debt obligations in detail. It tracks:
        *   Beginning and ending balances for each debt tranche (e.g., revolver, term loans, bonds).
        *   New borrowings (drawdowns).
        *   Scheduled principal repayments (amortization).
        *   Mandatory prepayments (e.g., from cash sweeps or asset sales).
        *   Optional prepayments.
        It calculates:
        *   Interest expense (cash and PIK) for each debt tranche based on outstanding balances and interest rates.
        *   Total debt outstanding.
        This information then flows into the Income Statement (interest expense) and Cash Flow Statement (changes in debt, interest paid).

13. **What is the final "check" or "plug" that ensures a 3-statement model is balanced? Explain briefly how this works.**
    *   **Answer:** The final "check" is ensuring the **Balance Sheet balances** (Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity). The "plug" that typically facilitates this is the **Cash and Cash Equivalents** line item on the Balance Sheet.
    *   The Cash Flow Statement calculates the ending cash balance (Beginning Cash + Net Change in Cash from Operations, Investing, and Financing). This calculated ending cash balance from the CFS then becomes the Cash asset figure on the Balance Sheet for that period. If all other parts of the model are linked correctly, this will make the Balance Sheet balance. Sometimes, a revolving credit facility or short-term debt acts as a plug to manage cash shortfalls or excesses, which also ultimately impacts the cash balance and ensures the balance sheet balances.

14. **A company has an EBIT of $20 million and Interest Expense of $5 million. What is its Interest Coverage Ratio (TIE)? What does this ratio indicate?**
    *   **Answer:**
        *   Interest Coverage Ratio (TIE) = EBIT / Interest Expense = $20 million / $5 million = **4.0x**
        *   This ratio indicates that the company's operating income (before interest and taxes) is sufficient to cover its interest expense 4 times over. A ratio of 4.0x generally suggests a healthy ability to meet interest obligations, providing a good cushion against a decline in earnings.

15. **Briefly describe the difference between Sensitivity Analysis and Scenario Analysis. Why would a credit analyst use both?**
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Examines the impact of changing *one single input variable* (assumption) at a time on a key output (e.g., how a 1% change in revenue growth affects Net Income or a specific ratio). It helps identify which assumptions are most critical to the model's outcomes.
        *   **Scenario Analysis:** Involves changing *multiple input variables simultaneously* to reflect a specific, plausible future state or narrative (e.g., a "base case," "recession case," "upside case"). It tests the model under different internally consistent sets of conditions.
        *   **Why use both:** A credit analyst uses **sensitivity analysis** to understand which individual assumptions are the most powerful drivers of risk and financial performance â€“ these are the assumptions that need the most scrutiny and robust support. They use **scenario analysis** to understand how the company might perform under broader, more holistic (and often more realistic) changes in the operating environment, assessing overall resilience and the range of potential outcomes. Together, they provide a more comprehensive view of risk.
