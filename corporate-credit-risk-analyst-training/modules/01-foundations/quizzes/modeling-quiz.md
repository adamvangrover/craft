**Part 1: Multiple Choice (Select the best answer)**

1.  What is the primary objective of building a 3-statement financial model for a credit analyst?
    a)  To determine the company's stock valuation.
    b)  To assess the company's ability to service its debt and understand its financial health under various scenarios.
    c)  To prepare the company's tax filings.
    d)  To exclusively forecast the income statement with perfect accuracy.

2.  Which of the following is a common best practice in financial modeling for differentiating hard-coded inputs from formulas?
    a)  Using bold font for inputs and regular font for formulas.
    b)  Using red font for inputs and black font for formulas.
    c)  Using blue font for inputs and black font for formulas.
    d)  Using italic font for inputs and underlined font for formulas.

3.  A "circular reference" in an Excel model most commonly occurs in a 3-statement model because:
    a)  Revenue growth assumptions are linked to historical revenue.
    b)  Interest expense affects net income, which affects cash flow, which can affect the debt balance that determines interest expense.
    c)  The balance sheet must always balance (Assets = Liabilities + Equity).
    d)  Depreciation expense on the income statement links to the PP&E schedule.

4.  If a company's Total Debt / EBITDA ratio increases from 3.0x to 5.0x, it generally signifies:
    a)  Improved creditworthiness and lower risk.
    b)  Decreased financial leverage.
    c)  Increased financial risk and higher leverage.
    d)  A stronger ability to cover interest payments.

5.  Which type of analysis typically involves changing multiple input variables simultaneously to model a specific, plausible future state (e.g., a "recession case")?
    a)  Sensitivity Analysis
    b)  Ratio Analysis
    c)  Scenario Analysis
    d)  Trend Analysis

6.  The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR) is often considered more comprehensive than the Interest Coverage Ratio (TIE) for credit analysis because:
    a)  It only considers interest payments.
    b)  It uses Net Income instead of EBIT or EBITDA in the numerator.
    c)  It typically includes other fixed charges like scheduled principal repayments and sometimes lease payments in its calculation.
    d)  It focuses solely on liquidity.

**Part 2: True/False (Indicate whether the statement is True or False)**

7.  True or False: In a 3-statement model, the Cash Flow Statement is typically forecasted directly by projecting individual cash inflows and outflows.
8.  True or False: Supporting schedules, such as a Debt Schedule or PP&E Schedule, are used to keep the main financial statements cleaner and make complex calculations more transparent.
9.  True or False: A Current Ratio of 0.8x indicates strong short-term liquidity for a company.
10. True or False: Stress Testing involves analyzing the impact of a small change in a single key assumption on a model output.
