# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 20 - Capstone Project

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 20 - Project Specific)

*   **Capstone Project:** A multifaceted assignment that serves as a culminating academic and intellectual experience for students, typically at the end of a program of study. It requires integrating and applying knowledge and skills learned throughout the program.
*   **Credit Memorandum (Comprehensive):** As detailed in Modules 5 & 15, but for the capstone, it implies a full, detailed write-up covering all aspects of the case study.
*   **3-Statement Financial Model (Integrated):** As detailed in Module 2, requiring historicals, projections for IS/BS/CFS, supporting schedules, ratio analysis, and balancing.
*   **Downside Scenario Analysis:** A critical component of the financial model, showing the impact of more pessimistic assumptions on financial performance and debt service capacity.
*   **Assumptions Log/Rationale:** A clear documentation of all key assumptions made in the financial model and analysis, with justifications. (Students should build this as they model).
*   **Executive Summary:** The concise, persuasive overview of the credit memo, including the recommendation and key supporting factors (Modules 5 & 15).
*   **Credit Committee Presentation Outline:** A structured plan for a verbal presentation of the credit analysis and recommendation, highlighting key findings and arguments.
*   **Deliverables:** The specific items required for submission as part of the capstone project (e.g., financial model Excel file, credit memo Word/PDF, presentation outline).
*   **Evaluation Criteria:** The standards and factors upon which the capstone project will be assessed.

## Recommended Resources & Prior Module Review:

This Capstone Project requires you to draw upon knowledge from virtually all preceding modules. It is highly recommended to revisit relevant modules as you work on specific parts of the project:

*   **Module 1 & 12 (Accounting & Advanced FSA/QoE):** For analyzing historical financials of "Innovatech Solutions Group (ISG)" and assessing earnings quality.
*   **Module 2 (Financial Modeling):** Essential for building the 3-statement model, projections, and scenario analysis.
*   **Module 3 & 13 (Capital Markets, Debt Structuring):** For understanding the requested facilities and thinking about appropriate terms/structures.
*   **Module 4 & 16 (Industry Analysis & SaaS Case):** For analyzing ISG's industry (industrial automation/robotics with a software component, drawing parallels from SaaS if helpful for the "Synapse" platform).
*   **Module 5 & 15 (Business Writing & Advanced Narrative):** Crucial for drafting a professional, clear, and persuasive credit memorandum.
*   **Module 6 (Critical Thinking & Narrative):** For identifying key risks/drivers, forming a credit thesis, and building a coherent argument.
*   **Module 8 (Underwriting):** For understanding the overall process and due diligence mindset.
*   **Module 9 (LBO/M&A):** While ISG is not an LBO, if the "expansion" involved an acquisition, these principles would be more directly relevant. Still useful for thinking about pro forma impacts of significant investments.
*   **Module 10 (Monitoring):** Thinking about what ongoing monitoring would entail for ISG post-funding.
*   **Module 14 (Legal Aspects):** For considering appropriate covenants and structural protections.

**Additional Resources for Project Management & Presentation Skills:**

*   **Time Management Resources:**
    *   Books like "Getting Things Done" by David Allen or "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey.
    *   Online articles and tools for project planning and task management (e.g., Trello, Asana for personal project tracking).
*   **Presentation Skills Resources:**
    *   "Talk Like TED" by Carmine Gallo.
    *   "Presentation Zen" by Garr Reynolds.
    *   Online courses on public speaking and presentation design (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning).
    *   Toastmasters International.

## Conceptual Tools for Capstone Project Management:

*   **Personal Project Plan Outline:**
    *   **Phase 1: Understanding & Initial Analysis**
        *   Thoroughly read and understand the case study.
        *   Initial thoughts on key risks/drivers.
        *   List information gaps (though for this case, you work with what's given).
        *   Outline credit memo structure.
    *   **Phase 2: Financial Modeling**
        *   Input historicals.
        *   Develop base case assumptions (document rationale).
        *   Build projection model (IS, BS, CFS, Debt, PP&E, WC schedules).
        *   Balance model.
        *   Calculate ratios.
        *   Develop downside scenario assumptions & model.
    *   **Phase 3: Qualitative Analysis & Synthesis**
        *   Detailed industry analysis.
        *   Management/Company assessment.
        *   Risk identification and mitigation strategy.
        *   Refine credit thesis.
    *   **Phase 4: Credit Memorandum Drafting**
        *   Draft each section.
        *   Focus on Executive Summary last, once all analysis is synthesized.
        *   Review and edit for clarity, conciseness, persuasion, grammar.
    *   **Phase 5: Presentation Outline**
        *   Develop key messages for each slide.
        *   Identify supporting charts/data.
    *   **Phase 6: Final Review**
        *   Check all deliverables against requirements.
        *   Proofread everything.
*   **Presentation Storyboard Template (Conceptual):**
    *   For each "slide" or section of your presentation outline:
        *   **Key Message/Headline:** (The one thing you want the audience to remember from this slide).
        *   **Supporting Data/Chart:** (What visual will you use? e.g., "Line chart of historical and projected revenue/EBITDA").
        *   **Key Talking Points:** (2-3 bullet points).
        *   **Anticipated Question(s):** (What might the committee ask here?).

*(Note: Effective project management, breaking the capstone into smaller, manageable tasks with self-imposed deadlines, will be key to successful completion.)*
