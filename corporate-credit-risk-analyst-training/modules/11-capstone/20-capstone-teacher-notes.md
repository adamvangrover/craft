# Teacher Notes: Module 20 - Capstone Project: Full Credit Analysis & Presentation

## Module Learning Objectives for Instructor Focus:

*   This module serves as the **ultimate assessment of a student's ability to integrate and apply** all knowledge and skills from the CRAFT program.
*   Evaluate student proficiency in **conducting a comprehensive credit analysis**, from financial modeling to qualitative risk assessment and industry analysis.
*   Assess the ability to **synthesize complex information into a coherent, persuasive credit memorandum**, particularly the Executive Summary and risk/mitigant discussion.
*   Gauge understanding of **loan structuring considerations** and the rationale for proposed terms/covenants.
*   Evaluate the student's ability to **plan and outline a professional presentation** of their findings suitable for a credit committee.
*   Provide a **realistic, challenging scenario** that mirrors the tasks an entry-level or junior credit analyst might undertake.

## Key Concepts for Student Application (Instructor to look for):

*   **Thorough Financial Modeling (Module 2):** Accurate historical input, logical projection drivers, supporting schedules, balanced model, scenario analysis.
*   **In-depth Financial Statement Analysis (Modules 1, 12):** Ratio interpretation, trend analysis, cash flow analysis, QoE considerations (even if simplified in case).
*   **Industry Analysis (Module 4, 16):** Application of Porter's or other frameworks to the given industry context (industrial automation/robotics), identification of specific industry KPIs and risks.
*   **Critical Thinking & Risk/Mitigant Identification (Module 6):** Clear articulation of key credit risks and well-reasoned, practical mitigants.
*   **Effective Written Communication (Modules 5, 15):** A well-structured, clear, concise, and persuasive credit memorandum.
*   **Understanding of Loan Structure & Covenants (Modules 3, 13, 14):** Justification for proposed loan terms and protective covenants.
*   **Holistic View:** Demonstrating an understanding of how all the pieces (company, industry, financials, structure) fit together to form a credit picture.

## Guidance for Evaluating Student Deliverables:

**1. 3-Statement Financial Model:**
*   **Accuracy:** Are historicals correctly inputted? Do formulas flow correctly? Does the model balance?
*   **Assumptions:** Are projection assumptions clearly stated and reasonable given the case study information? Is there a clear rationale?
*   **Completeness:** Are all necessary schedules (Debt, PP&E, Working Capital) present and functional?
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Is the downside scenario distinct, logical, and does it appropriately stress key assumptions? Is its impact analyzed?
*   **Ratio Analysis:** Are key ratios calculated correctly and presented clearly?

**2. Credit Memorandum:**
*   **Executive Summary:** Is it concise (ideally 1 page)? Clear recommendation? Does it effectively summarize key strengths, risks, and mitigants? Is it persuasive?
*   **Depth of Analysis:** Does each section (Borrower, Industry, Financial, Risk) demonstrate thorough analysis and critical thinking, not just recitation of facts?
*   **Risk Identification & Mitigation:** Are risks specific and material? Are proposed mitigants practical and directly linked to the risks?
*   **Logical Flow & Narrative:** Does the memo tell a coherent story and build a logical argument for the recommendation?
*   **Clarity & Professionalism:** Is the writing clear, concise, and free of major grammatical errors/typos? (Reflecting M5/M15).
*   **Application of Course Concepts:** Is there evidence of applying frameworks and concepts from various modules?

**3. Credit Committee Presentation Outline:**
*   **Completeness:** Does it cover all key areas expected in a credit committee presentation?
*   **Logical Structure:** Is the flow logical and easy to follow?
*   **Focus on Key Messages:** Does it highlight the most critical information for decision-makers?
*   **Clarity of Supporting Visuals:** Are the descriptions of proposed charts/graphs appropriate and supportive of the narrative?
*   **Time Management:** Does the outline seem feasible for a 15-20 minute presentation (i.e., not too much/too little detail per section)?

## Potential Challenges for Students & How to Guide Them:

*   **Information Overload/Synthesis:** The case provides a lot of information. Students may struggle to synthesize it and identify what's most important.
    *   *Guidance:* Encourage them to start with a high-level outline of their credit memo and fill it in. Remind them to focus on the "so what?" of each piece of data.
*   **Making Assumptions:** Students may be hesitant to make necessary assumptions for their model.
    *   *Guidance:* Explain that in the real world, analysts always work with incomplete information and must make reasonable, documented assumptions. Encourage them to state their assumptions clearly and provide a brief rationale.
*   **Balancing the Model:** This can be a technical hurdle.
    *   *Guidance:* Refer them back to Module 2. Suggest building the model in logical steps and frequently checking the balance sheet.
*   **Crafting the Narrative (especially Executive Summary):** Moving from detailed analysis to a concise, persuasive summary.
    *   *Guidance:* Suggest writing the detailed sections first, then drafting the Executive Summary to reflect the key findings and arguments. Iterate.
*   **Time Management for the Project:** It's a large undertaking.
    *   *Guidance:* Strongly recommend they create a personal project plan with intermediate deadlines for each deliverable.

## Activity Ideas (for a course using this Capstone):

*   **Mid-Point Check-in/Q&A:** Offer a session where students can ask clarifying questions about the case or their approach (without giving away answers).
*   **Peer Review (Optional):** If feasible, have students peer-review sections of each other's draft credit memos (e.g., just the Executive Summary or Risk Analysis section) using a structured feedback form.
*   **Mock Credit Committee Presentations (If applicable):** Selected students could present their findings based on their outline.

## Instructor Notes for Delivery (if used in a taught course):

*   **Set Clear Expectations:** Ensure students understand the scope, deliverables, and evaluation criteria upfront.
*   **Provide Necessary Tools/Templates (Optional):** Decide if you will provide a basic Excel shell for the model or if students should build from scratch.
*   **Emphasize Integration:** This project is about connecting all the dots from the entire course.
*   **Manage Scope:** While comprehensive, the "Innovatech" case is still simplified compared to a real-world deal. Acknowledge this. The goal is to assess application of learned skills within a defined scope.
*   **Feedback is Crucial:** Provide detailed, constructive feedback on their submissions, as this is a major learning opportunity.
