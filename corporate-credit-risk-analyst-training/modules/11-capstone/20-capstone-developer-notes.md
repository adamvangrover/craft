# Developer Notes: Module 20 - Capstone Project: Full Credit Analysis & Presentation

## Module Content & Structure Rationale:

*   **Culminating Experience:** This module is designed as the final, integrative project for the CRAFT program, requiring students to apply learnings from all previous modules.
*   **Realistic Scenario (Simplified):** The "Innovatech Solutions Group (ISG)" case study aims to provide a reasonably complex but manageable scenario for a foundational course. It includes elements of growth financing, R&D investment, and refinancing.
*   **Clear Deliverables:** The project requirements (3-statement model, credit memo, presentation outline) are standard outputs for credit analysts.
*   **Emphasis on Synthesis:** The core challenge for students is not just performing individual analyses but synthesizing them into a coherent recommendation and narrative.
*   **Guidance on Evaluation:** Providing general evaluation criteria helps set student expectations.
*   **Student Notes for Self-Management:** The student notes section encourages project planning and reflection.
*   **No Quiz/Answer Key:** This module is project-based. Evaluation is of the submitted project itself. The "Teacher Notes" provide guidance for instructors on what to look for.

## Suggestions for Future Updates & Expansions:

1.  **Provide a Detailed Excel Financial Data Shell:**
    *   To save students time on basic data entry and allow them to focus more on analysis and modeling logic, provide an Excel file with ISG's historical Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statement data already inputted in a structured format.
    *   This shell could also include placeholders for projection years and key schedules.
2.  **More Granular Case Study Data:**
    *   Add more specific (but still hypothetical) details to the ISG case, such as:
        *   Breakdown of software vs. hardware gross margins.
        *   More detail on working capital assumptions (DSO, DIH, DPO for historicals).
        *   Specific terms of existing debt.
        *   More color on customer contracts or supplier terms.
    *   This would allow for a more nuanced model and analysis but also increases complexity.
3.  **Multiple Case Study Options:**
    *   Over time, develop 2-3 alternative capstone case studies (e.g., a company in a different industry, an LBO scenario, a distressed situation for a restructuring proposal) that students could choose from or be assigned. This would provide variety if the course is run multiple times.
4.  **Example of a "Good" (but not perfect) Credit Memo:**
    *   Provide a sample credit memo (for a *different* hypothetical case, not ISG) that exemplifies good structure, analysis, and narrative. This gives students a target to aim for.
5.  **Peer Review Component (Formalized):**
    *   Develop a structured peer review process where students exchange draft credit memos or model components and provide feedback using a defined rubric.
6.  **"Office Hours" Simulation:**
    *   If used in an instructor-led setting, the case could include prompts for students to "prepare questions for a meeting with the CFO" or "prepare for a call with the industry expert," and these could be role-played.
7.  **Automated Checks for Model (Basic):**
    *   If the platform ever supports it, simple automated checks for the Excel model (e.g., does the balance sheet balance? Are key ratios calculated?) could be a future thought, though complex to implement.

## Source Information & Key References:

*   The ISG case study is entirely hypothetical, designed to incorporate elements from various modules.
*   The structure of the deliverables (model, memo, presentation outline) reflects common industry practices for credit analysts.

## Maintenance & Update Frequency:

*   **Case Study Data:** The core ISG case can remain stable for a while. If specific market data or interest rates are embedded and become very outdated, they might need minor tweaks.
*   **Industry Context (Industrial Automation/Robotics):** While the case is simplified, if major real-world shifts occur in this industry that make the case feel anachronistic, the "Industry & Market Notes" might need updating.
*   **Evaluation Criteria:** General principles are stable.
*   **Links to Modules:** If module numbers/titles change, these references would need updating.

## Notes on Placeholder Content to be Developed:

*   **Learning Materials:** The `20-capstone-learning-materials.md` focuses on project management and revisiting prior modules.
*   **Teacher Notes:** The `20-capstone-teacher-notes.md` provides guidance on evaluating student submissions and potential challenges. This is the primary "solution guide" for the instructor.

The Capstone Project is the most important module for assessing overall student learning. Clarity of instructions, a well-defined (but not overly restrictive) case, and clear evaluation criteria are key to its success. The focus should be on the student's ability to *think like an analyst* and apply the tools and concepts learned.
