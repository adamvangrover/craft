# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 4 - Industry & Competitive Analysis

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 4)

*   **Adjusted FFO (AFFO):** Funds From Operations (FFO) adjusted for recurring capital expenditures and other items to provide a clearer picture of a REIT's cash flow available for distribution. *Relevance: Key REIT performance and valuation metric.*
*   **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) / Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** The predictable revenue a company expects to receive from its active subscriptions over a year/month. *Relevance: Critical KPI for SaaS and subscription-based businesses.*
*   **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** Total revenue divided by the number of subscribers or users. *Relevance: Key metric for telecom, media, and subscription businesses.*
*   **Bargaining Power of Buyers:** The ability of customers to exert pressure on industry players, typically by demanding lower prices or higher quality.
*   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** The ability of suppliers of inputs to raise prices or reduce the quality of goods/services they provide.
*   **Barriers to Entry:** Obstacles that make it difficult for new companies to enter a specific industry (e.g., high capital requirements, economies of scale, brand loyalty, government regulation, patents, network effects).
*   **Churn Rate:** The rate at which customers stop doing business with a company (e.g., cancel subscriptions). *Relevance: High churn is detrimental to businesses with recurring revenue models.*
*   **Complements (Complementors):** Products or services that increase the value of another product or service when used together (e.g., software for computer hardware, apps for smartphones). Porter's original model doesn't explicitly include this "sixth force," but it's an important consideration.

*   **Gross/Net Dollar Retention:** Measures revenue retained from existing customers over a period, accounting for upgrades, downgrades, and churn. Net Dollar Retention above 100% indicates expansion revenue from existing customers exceeds losses from churn/downgrades. *Relevance: Key SaaS metric indicating customer satisfaction and growth potential within the existing base.*
*   **Industry Analysis:** The process of evaluating the environment in which a company operates, including its structure, competitive dynamics, profit potential, and key risks and opportunities.
*   **Industry Cyclicality:** The tendency for an industry's sales and profits to fluctuate with the overall business cycle.
*   **Industry Lifecycle (Growth, Maturity, Decline):** The different stages an industry passes through over time, each with distinct competitive characteristics, growth rates, and profitability profiles.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Specific, measurable values that demonstrate how effectively a company (or industry) is achieving key business objectives. KPIs are crucial for understanding an industry's unique value drivers and operational levers.
*   **Load Factor (Airlines):** The percentage of available seating capacity that is filled with paying passengers. *Relevance: Key airline capacity utilization metric.*
*   **Net Asset Value (NAV) (REITs):** An estimate of a REIT's per-share market value based on the current market values of its properties, less total liabilities. *Relevance: Common valuation metric for REITs.*
*   **Network Effects:** A phenomenon whereby a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it (e.g., social media, online marketplaces). Can be a powerful barrier to entry.
*   **PESTLE Analysis:** A framework for analyzing macro-environmental factors: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental.
*   **Porter's Five Forces:** A framework for analyzing the competitive structure of an industry: Threat of New Entrants, Bargaining Power of Buyers, Bargaining Power of Suppliers, Threat of Substitute Products or Services, and Rivalry Among Existing Competitors.
*   **Product Differentiation:** The process of distinguishing a product or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular target market.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The risk that changes in laws and regulations will materially impact an industry's operations, costs, or profitability.
*   **Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM):** A measure of an airline's revenue generation per unit of capacity. *Relevance: Key airline revenue efficiency metric.*
*   **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:** The intensity of competition between firms already operating within the industry.
*   **Same-Store Sales (SSS) / Comparable Store Sales:** A retail KPI that measures revenue growth from existing stores open for a specified period (usually one year), excluding the impact of new store openings or closures. *Relevance: Indicates organic growth and health of existing retail operations.*
*   **Supply Chain Risk:** Risks associated with the flow of goods and services from raw materials to the end customer.
*   **SWOT Analysis:** A framework for identifying Strengths, Weaknesses (internal factors), Opportunities, and Threats (external factors).
*   **Switching Costs:** Costs (financial, operational, or psychological) that a customer incurs when changing from one supplier or product to another.
*   **Technological Disruption:** Innovation that significantly alters the way consumers, industries, or businesses operate.
*   **Threat of New Entrants:** The risk that new competitors will enter an industry and erode the market share and profitability of existing firms.
*   **Threat of Substitute Products or Services:** The risk that products or services from *outside* the traditional industry boundaries will meet the same customer needs.

## Conceptual Industry Analysis Prompts

To practice applying these frameworks:

1.  **Quick Five Forces Analysis:**
    *   Choose an industry you are familiar with (e.g., fast food, ride-sharing, social media, apparel retail).
    *   For each of Porter's Five Forces:
        *   List 1-2 factors that you believe make the force strong (negative for industry profitability).
        *   List 1-2 factors that you believe make the force weak (positive for industry profitability).
    *   Based on your assessment, is this industry structurally attractive (i.e., conducive to high average profitability) or unattractive? Why?

2.  **PESTLE Factor Identification:**
    *   Consider the global automotive industry.
    *   Identify one current **P**olitical factor (e.g., trade tariffs, emissions regulations) and one major **T**echnological factor (e.g., autonomous driving, EV technology) significantly impacting it.
    *   Briefly describe the potential positive or negative credit implications of these factors for incumbent automakers.

3.  **KPI Brainstorm:**
    *   Think about the **streaming video industry** (e.g., Netflix, Disney+).
    *   What would be 3-4 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that you would want to track to assess the health and competitive positioning of a company in this industry? Explain why each KPI is important.
