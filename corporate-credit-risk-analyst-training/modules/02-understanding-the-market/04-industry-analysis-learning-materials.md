# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 4 - Industry & Competitive Analysis

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 4)

*   **Industry Analysis:** The process of evaluating the environment in which a company operates, including its structure, competitive dynamics, profit potential, and key risks and opportunities.
*   **Porter's Five Forces:** A framework developed by Michael Porter for analyzing the competitive structure of an industry. The five forces are: Threat of New Entrants, Bargaining Power of Buyers, Bargaining Power of Suppliers, Threat of Substitute Products or Services, and Rivalry Among Existing Competitors.
*   **Threat of New Entrants:** The risk that new competitors will enter an industry and erode the market share and profitability of existing firms.
*   **Barriers to Entry:** Obstacles that make it difficult for new companies to enter a specific industry (e.g., high capital requirements, economies of scale, brand loyalty, government regulation, patents).
*   **Bargaining Power of Buyers:** The ability of customers to exert pressure on industry players, typically by demanding lower prices or higher quality.
*   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** The ability of suppliers of inputs (labor, raw materials, components) to raise prices or reduce the quality of goods/services they provide.
*   **Threat of Substitute Products or Services:** The risk that products or services from *outside* the traditional industry boundaries will meet the same customer needs, potentially making the industry's offerings obsolete or less attractive.
*   **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:** The intensity of competition between firms already operating within the industry (e.g., price wars, advertising battles, innovation races).
*   **Switching Costs:** Costs (financial, operational, or psychological) that a customer incurs when changing from one supplier or product to another.
*   **Economies of Scale:** Cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, with cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale.
*   **Product Differentiation:** The process of distinguishing a product or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular target market.
*   **Industry Cyclicality:** The tendency for an industry's sales and profits to fluctuate with the overall business cycle (e.g., automotive, construction are highly cyclical).
*   **Technological Disruption:** Innovation that significantly alters the way consumers, industries, or businesses operate, often displacing established technologies and creating new industry leaders.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The risk that changes in laws and regulations will materially impact an industry's operations, costs, or profitability.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Specific, measurable values that demonstrate how effectively a company (or industry) is achieving key business objectives. KPIs vary significantly by industry.
*   **PESTLE Analysis:** A framework for analyzing macro-environmental factors: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental.
*   **SWOT Analysis:** A framework for identifying Strengths, Weaknesses (internal factors), Opportunities, and Threats (external factors) relevant to an organization or industry.
*   **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Risks:** Risks arising from environmental issues (e.g., climate change, pollution), social factors (e.g., labor practices, data privacy), and corporate governance (e.g., board structure, ethics).
*   **Supply Chain Risk:** Risks associated with the flow of goods and services from raw materials to the end customer, including disruptions, supplier concentration, and price volatility.

## Recommended Reading & External Resources

*   **Michael Porter - "Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors" (Book):** The seminal work that introduced the Five Forces framework. A foundational read for deep understanding.
*   **Harvard Business Review (HBR) - Articles by Michael Porter:** Search for articles like "The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy."
*   **IBISWorld:** (Subscription-based) Provides detailed industry reports for numerous sectors, often including analysis of competitive landscapes, market trends, and KPIs. Many university libraries offer access.
*   **Statista:** (Subscription-based, some free content) Offers market data, statistics, and industry reports.
*   **Industry-Specific Trade Associations:** Most industries have trade associations that publish reports, data, and news relevant to their sector (e.g., National Retail Federation, Semiconductor Industry Association).
*   **Market Research Firms:** Companies like Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, BCG often publish reports and insights on industry trends and competitive dynamics (some free, some paid).
*   **Company Annual Reports (10-Ks):** The "Business" section and "Risk Factors" section of a public company's annual report often provide valuable insights into its industry, competitive positioning, and key risks.

## Downloadable Templates (Conceptual)

*   **Porter's Five Forces Analysis Worksheet:**
    *   A structured template with sections for each of the five forces.
    *   Prompts for identifying key factors contributing to the strength of each force (e.g., for "Threat of New Entrants," list specific barriers to entry).
    *   Space to assess the strength of each force (Low, Medium, High) and provide justification.
    *   A section for summarizing the overall industry attractiveness based on the analysis.
*   **Industry Risk Identification Matrix:**
    *   Rows for different risk categories (e.g., Cyclicality, Technological Disruption, Regulatory, ESG, Supply Chain, Competitive Intensity).
    *   Columns for:
        *   Specific Risk Description for the Industry.
        *   Potential Impact on a Company in the Industry (e.g., on revenue, margins, cash flow).
        *   Common Mitigants employed by industry players.
*   **PESTLE Analysis Framework Template:**
    *   Sections for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors.
    *   Prompts to list key trends and potential impacts for each factor on the specific industry being analyzed.
