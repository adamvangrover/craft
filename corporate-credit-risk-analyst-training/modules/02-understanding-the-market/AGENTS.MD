## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 02 - Understanding the Market

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`02-understanding-the-market/`) covers:
1.  **Capital Markets & Leveraged Loans:** The capital ecosystem, debt spectrum, leveraged loan market, credit agreements, and covenants.
2.  **Industry Analysis:** Importance of industry context, Porter's Five Forces, and identifying industry-specific risks.

The main guide for this module is `README.md`. Content is detailed in:
*   `03-capital-markets-and-leveraged-loans.md` (and its `learning-materials.md`)
*   `04-industry-analysis.md` (and its `learning-materials.md`)
Case studies and quizzes are in their respective subdirectories.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** The `03-*.md` and `04-*.md` files contain primary explanations.
*   **Learning Materials:** `*-learning-materials.md` files for glossaries/links.
*   **Case Studies & Quizzes:** Located in `case-studies/` and `quizzes/`. These should have their own `README.md` and `index.html` if they grow to contain multiple files, or be simple `.md` files if singular.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Ensure clear explanations of abstract concepts like different covenant types or the forces in Porter's model.
    *   Provide practical examples (e.g., sample covenant language snippets, application of Porter's to various industries).

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Capital Markets:** Clearly differentiate primary/secondary markets, sell-side/buy-side. Explain debt hierarchy logically.
*   **Leveraged Loans & Credit Agreements:** Demystify jargon. Explain the "why" behind different covenant types. The "covenant-lite" discussion is important.
*   **Industry Analysis:** Porter's Five Forces should be explained with a clear example. Emphasize that it's an analytical framework, not just a list.
*   **Practical Relevance:** Continuously link these market and industry concepts back to how they impact a credit analyst's assessment of a specific company.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link all key terms to both local CRAFT `GLOSSARY.md` and `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Link Porter's Five Forces to the `Market_Analysis_Quick_Start/` section if it also discusses similar frameworks.
*   Connect discussions of loan documentation/covenants to Module 14 (Legal Aspects) and the `Interactive_Notebooks/Legal_Analysis/` notebook.
*   Link industry analysis concepts to `primers/` for specific industry details.

Refer to parent `AGENTS.MD` files for broader CRAFT program and repository guidelines.
