# Agent Instructions - CRAFT Module 02: Understanding the Market

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this specific module directory.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain CRAFT program style, formatting, and tone. Refer to main CRAFT `AGENTS.MD` and other module `AGENTS.MD` files.
*   **Clarity and Detail:** Explain capital market concepts, loan terms, and industry analysis frameworks clearly.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Use Markdown effectively.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all definitions, market mechanics, and analytical frameworks (like Porter's Five Forces) are accurate.
*   **File Naming:** Follow existing conventions (e.g., `03-capital-markets-and-leveraged-loans.md`, `case-studies/industry-analysis-case-study.md`).
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Link to glossaries. Verify functionality.
*   **Updating Navigation:**
    *   Module navigation is via `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/modules/02-understanding-the-market/index.html`. Ensure its `filesInDir` and `subDirsInfo` are accurate if content files are added/removed.
    *   The main CRAFT Hub also links here.
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 02 - Understanding the Market

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`02-understanding-the-market/`) covers:
1.  **Capital Markets & Leveraged Loans:** The capital ecosystem, debt spectrum, leveraged loan market, credit agreements, and covenants.
2.  **Industry Analysis:** Importance of industry context, Porter's Five Forces, and identifying industry-specific risks.

The main guide for this module is `README.md`. Content is detailed in:
*   `03-capital-markets-and-leveraged-loans.md` (and its `learning-materials.md`)
*   `04-industry-analysis.md` (and its `learning-materials.md`)
Case studies and quizzes are in their respective subdirectories.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** The `03-*.md` and `04-*.md` files contain primary explanations.
*   **Learning Materials:** `*-learning-materials.md` files for glossaries/links.
*   **Case Studies & Quizzes:** Located in `case-studies/` and `quizzes/`. These should have their own `README.md` and `index.html` if they grow to contain multiple files, or be simple `.md` files if singular.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Ensure clear explanations of abstract concepts like different covenant types or the forces in Porter's model.
    *   Provide practical examples (e.g., sample covenant language snippets, application of Porter's to various industries).

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Capital Markets:** Clearly differentiate primary/secondary markets, sell-side/buy-side. Explain debt hierarchy logically.
*   **Leveraged Loans & Credit Agreements:** Demystify jargon. Explain the "why" behind different covenant types. The "covenant-lite" discussion is important.
*   **Industry Analysis:** Porter's Five Forces should be explained with a clear example. Emphasize that it's an analytical framework, not just a list.
*   **Practical Relevance:** Continuously link these market and industry concepts back to how they impact a credit analyst's assessment of a specific company.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link all key terms to both local CRAFT `GLOSSARY.md` and `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Link Porter's Five Forces to the `Market_Analysis_Quick_Start/` section if it also discusses similar frameworks.
*   Connect discussions of loan documentation/covenants to Module 14 (Legal Aspects) and the `Interactive_Notebooks/Legal_Analysis/` notebook.
*   Link industry analysis concepts to `primers/` for specific industry details.

### 5. Content Expansion Guidelines (New Mandate)
In addition to the above, all content within this module should be enhanced to:
*   **Incorporate Historical Context:**
    *   For capital markets: Briefly touch upon the evolution of loan markets, e.g., the rise of institutional term loans, covenant-lite trends.
    *   For industry analysis: Mention how certain industries have been reshaped by major economic or technological shifts (e.g., impact of e-commerce on retail).
*   **Integrate Real-World Case Studies/Examples:**
    *   Use examples of specific covenant breaches and their consequences (anonymized or public).
    *   Illustrate Porter's Five Forces with concise examples from diverse industries.
    *   Discuss historical examples of how industry cyclicality or disruption impacted credit quality for companies in that sector.
*   **Detail Key Terms, Concepts, and Structures:**
    *   **Leveraged Loans:** Clearly explain typical loan structures (e.g., Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B), pricing (LIBOR/SOFR + spread, OID), syndication process, and key players (Arrangers, Agents, Lenders).
    *   **Covenants:** Provide more examples of specific financial covenants (Leverage, Coverage, CapEx limits) and affirmative/negative covenants. Explain the rationale behind them from a lender's perspective.
    *   **Industry Analysis:** For each of Porter's Five Forces, provide more detailed examples of factors that strengthen or weaken each force. Discuss limitations of the framework or alternative/complementary frameworks if appropriate (e.g., PESTLE analysis at a high level).
*   **Provide Foundational Knowledge:** If concepts like "moral hazard" or "adverse selection" are relevant to credit markets or lending, briefly explain them.
*   **Develop Walkthroughs:**
    *   Conceptually walk through how a credit agreement's key sections are typically structured.
    *   Provide a mini-walkthrough of applying Porter's Five Forces to a chosen sample industry.

This expansion should aim to make the market and industry understanding more robust, practical, and grounded in real-world application for trainees.
