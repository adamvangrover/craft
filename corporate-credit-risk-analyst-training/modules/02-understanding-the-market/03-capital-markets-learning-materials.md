# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 3 - Capital Markets & Leveraged Loans

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 3)

*   **Capital Markets:** Financial markets where savings and investments are channeled between suppliers of capital (e.g., investors) and those who are in need of capital (e.g., businesses, governments). Includes primary and secondary markets.
*   **Primary Market:** The market where new securities (stocks, bonds, loans) are issued for the first time. Proceeds go directly to the issuer.
*   **Secondary Market:** The market where previously issued securities are traded among investors. Provides liquidity and price discovery. (e.g., NYSE, Nasdaq, OTC bond market).
*   **Sell-Side:** Financial institutions (primarily investment banks) that originate, underwrite, structure, and sell securities.
*   **Buy-Side:** Institutional investors (e.g., mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, CLOs) that purchase and manage portfolios of securities.
*   **Capital Structure:** The specific mix of debt and equity a company uses to finance its assets and operations. Hierarchical in terms of claim priority.
*   **Senior Secured Debt:** Debt that has the highest priority claim on a company's assets and cash flows, and is backed by specific collateral. (e.g., Revolvers, Term Loans).
*   **Revolving Credit Facility (Revolver):** A flexible line of credit allowing a borrower to draw, repay, and re-borrow funds up to a limit.
*   **Term Loan:** A loan with a specified principal amount, a set maturity date, and often a periodic repayment (amortization) schedule. (e.g., Term Loan A, Term Loan B).
*   **Senior Unsecured Debt:** Debt (often bonds) that ranks senior to subordinated debt but is not backed by specific collateral.
*   **High-Yield Bonds (Junk Bonds):** Bonds issued by companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings, offering higher yields for higher risk.
*   **Subordinated Debt (Junior Debt):** Debt that ranks below senior debt in claim priority. Higher risk, higher coupon.
*   **Mezzanine Finance:** A hybrid form of financing, often structured as subordinated debt with equity-like features (e.g., warrants, PIK interest).
*   **Paid-in-Kind (PIK) Interest:** Interest that is not paid in cash but is added to the principal balance of the loan, increasing the total amount owed.
*   **Warrants:** Options granting the holder the right to buy a company's stock at a specific price for a specific period.
*   **Leveraged Loan:** A syndicated bank loan extended to companies that are already highly levered or have non-investment-grade credit ratings.
*   **Syndicated Loan:** A large loan in which a group of lenders (a syndicate) jointly provides funds to a single borrower. Managed by lead arrangers.
*   **Lead Arranger/Bookrunner:** An investment bank that structures, underwrites, and distributes a syndicated loan or bond issue.
*   **Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO):** A structured finance vehicle that buys portfolios of leveraged loans and finances them by issuing tranches of debt and equity with varying risk/return profiles. A major buyer of leveraged loans.
*   **Credit Agreement:** The legally binding contract detailing the terms and conditions of a loan between lenders and a borrower.
*   **Covenants:** Rules of conduct for the borrower set forth in a credit agreement, designed to protect lenders.
    *   **Affirmative Covenants:** Actions the borrower *must* perform (e.g., provide financials, pay taxes).
    *   **Negative Covenants:** Actions the borrower *cannot* perform without lender consent (e.g., incur more debt, sell key assets, make large restricted payments).
    *   **Financial Covenants:** Requirements for the borrower to maintain certain financial ratios (e.g., maximum leverage, minimum coverage).
        *   **Maintenance Covenants:** Must be met continuously (tested periodically, usually quarterly).
        *   **Incurrence Covenants:** Tested only when the borrower takes a specific action (e.g., issuing new debt).
*   **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** A common proxy for operating cash flow, frequently used in financial covenant definitions (though its specific definition in a credit agreement can be heavily negotiated).
*   **Representations and Warranties ("Reps & Warranties"):** Statements of fact made by the borrower in a credit agreement, the inaccuracy of which can lead to default.
*   **Conditions Precedent (CPs):** Conditions that must be met before a loan can be funded.
*   **Events of Default (EoDs):** Specific events that trigger a default, allowing lenders to exercise remedies (e.g., accelerate repayment).
*   **Covenant-Lite (Cov-Lite) Loan:** A loan that lacks financial maintenance covenants, offering more flexibility to the borrower but potentially less early warning for lenders. Still contains negative covenants.
*   **Price Flex:** Adjustments to the interest rate spread (and sometimes other terms) of a loan during syndication based on investor demand.
