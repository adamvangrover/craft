*   **Affirmative Covenants:** Actions the borrower *must* perform under a credit agreement (e.g., provide financials, pay taxes).
*   **Baskets (in Covenants):** Specific allowances or permissions within negative covenants that allow a borrower to undertake certain restricted actions up to a predefined limit (e.g., a $10M debt basket, or a ratio-based basket for acquisitions).
*   **Bookrunner (Lead Arranger):** An investment bank that structures, underwrites, and distributes a syndicated loan or bond issue, and typically "runs the books" (manages investor orders).
*   **Buy-Side:** Institutional investors (e.g., mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, CLOs, private credit funds) that purchase and manage portfolios of securities.
*   **Capital Markets:** Financial markets where savings and investments are channeled between suppliers of capital and those who need capital. Includes primary and secondary markets.
*   **Capital Structure:** The specific mix of debt and equity a company uses to finance its assets and operations. Hierarchical in terms of claim priority (seniority).
*   **Collateral Agent:** A financial institution designated to hold and administer the collateral pledged by a borrower for the benefit of secured lenders in a credit facility.
*   **Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO):** A structured finance vehicle that buys portfolios of leveraged loans and finances them by issuing tranches of debt and equity with varying risk/return profiles. A major buyer of leveraged loans.
*   **Conditions Precedent (CPs):** Conditions that must be met before a loan can be funded.
*   **Covenant-Lite (Cov-Lite) Loan:** A loan that lacks financial maintenance covenants, offering more flexibility to the borrower but potentially less early warning for lenders. Still contains negative covenants.
*   **Covenants:** Rules of conduct for the borrower set forth in a credit agreement, designed to protect lenders.
*   **Credit Agreement:** The legally binding contract detailing the terms and conditions of a loan between lenders and a borrower.
*   **Credit Spread (or Margin):** The additional interest rate (in basis points) charged above a benchmark rate (like SOFR) to compensate lenders for the borrower's credit risk.
*   **Credit Spread Adjustment (CSA):** A small adjustment added to SOFR-based loans to account for the difference from LIBOR, which had a credit component.
*   **Direct Lending (Private Credit):** Lending directly to companies by non-bank institutions (private credit funds), often for middle-market borrowers, as an alternative to syndicated loans or public bonds.
*   **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** A common proxy for operating cash flow, frequently used in financial covenant definitions (though its specific definition in a credit agreement can be heavily negotiated and may include many "add-backs").
*   **Equity Cure Rights:** Provisions in some credit agreements allowing a private equity sponsor or other equity holders to contribute equity to the borrower to "cure" a breach of a financial maintenance covenant, often by effectively increasing EBITDA or reducing debt for the covenant calculation.
*   **Events of Default (EoDs):** Specific events that trigger a default, allowing lenders to exercise remedies (e.g., accelerate repayment).
*   **Financial Covenants:** Requirements for the borrower to maintain certain financial ratios (e.g., maximum leverage, minimum coverage).
    *   **Incurrence Covenants:** Tested only when the borrower takes a specific action (e.g., issuing new debt).
    *   **Maintenance Covenants:** Must be met continuously (tested periodically, usually quarterly).
*   **High-Yield Bonds (Junk Bonds):** Bonds issued by companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings, offering higher yields for higher risk.
*   **Increased Costs Clause:** A provision in a credit agreement that protects lenders from increased costs associated with funding or maintaining a loan due to changes in regulations or other specified circumstances.
*   **Information Memorandum (IM) / Offering Memorandum (OM):** A detailed marketing document prepared for potential lenders/investors in a loan syndication or bond issuance, outlining the company, industry, financials, and terms of the security.
*   **Lead Arranger:** See Bookrunner.
*   **Leveraged Loan:** A syndicated bank loan extended to companies that are already highly levered or have non-investment-grade credit ratings.
*   **Material Adverse Change (MAC) Clause:** A clause in a credit agreement that can allow lenders to refuse funding or call a default if there has been a significant negative change in the borrower's business, operations, or financial condition. Often highly negotiated and its invocation can be contentious.
*   **Mezzanine Finance:** A hybrid form of financing, often structured as subordinated debt with equity-like features (e.g., warrants, PIK interest) to enhance returns for lenders taking higher risk.
*   **Negative Covenants:** Actions the borrower *cannot* perform without lender consent or via permitted baskets (e.g., incur more debt, sell key assets, make large restricted payments).
*   **Original Issue Discount (OID):** When a loan or bond is issued at a price below its par value (e.g., issued at 99, meaning $99 paid for $100 face value). This increases the effective yield for the investor.
*   **Paid-in-Kind (PIK) Interest:** Interest that is not paid in cash but is added to the principal balance of the loan, increasing the total amount owed. Conserves cash for the borrower but increases overall debt.
*   **Price Flex:** Adjustments to the interest rate spread or OID of a loan during syndication based on investor demand.
*   **Primary Market:** The market where new securities (stocks, bonds, loans) are issued for the first time. Proceeds go directly to the issuer.
*   **Private Credit:** See Direct Lending.
*   **Representations and Warranties ("Reps & Warranties"):** Statements of fact made by the borrower in a credit agreement, the inaccuracy of which can lead to default.
*   **Revolving Credit Facility (Revolver):** A flexible line of credit allowing a borrower to draw, repay, and re-borrow funds up to a limit.
*   **Secondary Market:** The market where previously issued securities are traded among investors. Provides liquidity and price discovery.

*   **Sell-Side:** Financial institutions (primarily investment banks) that originate, underwrite, structure, and sell securities.
*   **Senior Secured Debt:** Debt that has the highest priority claim on a company's assets and cash flows, and is backed by specific collateral.
*   **Senior Unsecured Debt:** Debt (often bonds) that ranks senior to subordinated debt but is not backed by specific collateral.
*   **Subordinated Debt (Junior Debt):** Debt that ranks below senior debt in claim priority. Higher risk, higher coupon.
*   **Syndicated Loan:** A large loan in which a group of lenders (a syndicate) jointly provides funds to a single borrower. Managed by lead arrangers.
*   **Term Loan:** A loan with a specified principal amount, a set maturity date, and often a periodic repayment (amortization) schedule.
    *   **Term Loan A (TLA):** Typically amortizing, sold to banks, shorter tenor.
    *   **Term Loan B (TLB):** Often has minimal or no amortization ("bullet" maturity), sold to institutional investors, longer tenor.
*   **Term SOFR:** Forward-looking term rates based on SOFR futures, available for different tenors (e.g., 1-month, 3-month, 6-month) and commonly used in loan agreements.
*   **Warrants:** Options granting the holder the right to buy a company's stock at a specific price for a specific period, often given as an "equity kicker" in mezzanine financing.
*   **Yield Protection Clause:** A provision in credit agreements ensuring lenders achieve their anticipated yield, even if borrowers prepay loans or if certain taxes/costs are imposed.
*   **Yield-to-Maturity (YTM):** The total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures. Expressed as an annual rate.

## Market Indicators & Data Points for Leveraged Finance

Credit analysts often monitor these indicators to understand market conditions:

*   **Leveraged Loan Issuance Volumes:** Tracks primary market activity (e.g., from LCD by S&P, LSTA).
*   **Average Spreads & OID Levels:** For new issues by rating category (e.g., B, BB), indicating risk appetite and pricing power.
*   **Default Rates & Forecasts:** Historical and projected default rates for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds (e.g., from Moody's, S&P, Fitch).
*   **Secondary Loan Prices & Indices:** Price movements of traded loans (e.g., S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index) reflect market sentiment and perceived credit quality.
