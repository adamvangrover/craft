# Case Study: Module 4 - Industry Analysis: "GlobalBrew Coffee Co."

This case study is designed to allow you to apply the concepts learned in Module 4, particularly Porter's Five Forces framework and broader industry risk identification, to a hypothetical company.

## Case Study Scenario: GlobalBrew Coffee Co.

**Company Overview:**
GlobalBrew Coffee Co. ("GlobalBrew" or "the Company") is a medium-sized, publicly traded company specializing in sourcing, roasting, and distributing premium coffee beans and ground coffee. They operate primarily in North America and Western Europe. GlobalBrew sells its products through three main channels:
1.  **Wholesale:** Supplying roasted beans and ground coffee to independent cafes, restaurants, and specialty grocery stores (approx. 60% of revenue).
2.  **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC):** Online subscription service delivering coffee directly to consumers (approx. 30% of revenue, fastest-growing segment).
3.  **Company-Owned Cafes:** A small chain of 25 branded cafes in major metropolitan areas (approx. 10% of revenue).

GlobalBrew prides itself on its ethical sourcing practices, relationships with coffee farming cooperatives, and unique roasting profiles that command a premium price point.

**Industry Background: The Premium Coffee Market**

The global coffee market is vast, but GlobalBrew operates within the "premium" or "specialty" coffee segment. This segment is characterized by:
*   **Higher Consumer Expectations:** Focus on bean origin, quality, flavor profile, roasting techniques, and sustainability.
*   **Fragmented Roaster/Supplier Base:** While a few large players exist (e.g., Starbucks, Nestlé's Nespresso, JDE Peet's), the premium segment also features numerous small to medium-sized independent roasters and cafes.
*   **Volatile Green Coffee Bean Prices:** Green (unroasted) coffee beans are a commodity, and prices can fluctuate significantly based on weather, crop yields in key growing regions (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, Ethiopia), geopolitical factors, and global supply/demand.
*   **Growing At-Home Consumption:** Trends show an increase in consumers brewing premium coffee at home, boosted further by the pandemic. Online DTC channels have grown rapidly.
*   **Intense Competition for Shelf Space & Distribution:** Getting products into grocery stores and cafes requires significant effort and marketing spend.
*   **Low Switching Costs for End Consumers (Retail):** While some brand loyalty exists, consumers can easily try different coffee brands. Switching costs for wholesale cafe customers might be slightly higher due to relationships and potentially co-branded materials.
*   **Increasing Focus on Sustainability & Ethical Sourcing:** Consumers and businesses are increasingly demanding transparency and ethical practices in coffee supply chains.

**Recent Developments:**
*   Several large multinational food & beverage companies have been acquiring smaller, successful premium coffee brands to gain entry into this growing market.
*   The cost of green coffee beans has seen a 30% increase over the past 18 months due to adverse weather in Brazil.
*   New, well-funded DTC coffee startups are emerging, often with aggressive digital marketing strategies.
*   Logistics and shipping costs have increased globally.
