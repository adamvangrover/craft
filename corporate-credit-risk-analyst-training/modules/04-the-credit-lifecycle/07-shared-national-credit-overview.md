# Module 7: Shared National Credit (SNC) Overview & Criteria

## 7.1. Understanding the SNC Program: Purpose and Scope
The **Shared National Credit (SNC) Program** is a long-standing and crucial component of the U.S. banking regulatory landscape, established in 1977. Its primary purpose is to provide a consistent, uniform, and efficient review and classification of the largest and most complex syndicated loans held by multiple federally supervised financial institutions. This helps to:
*   Ensure consistency in regulatory credit risk assessment across different banks and regulatory agencies.
*   Identify concentrations of credit risk within the banking system (systemic risk).
*   Monitor trends in underwriting standards and risk management practices for large corporate loans.
*   Provide an early warning of potential asset quality problems in the banking sector.

The program is governed by an interagency agreement among the three main federal bank regulators in the UnitedSstates:
*   The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRS)
*   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
*   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)

**What qualifies as an SNC?**
A credit facility (loan, loan commitment, letter of credit, etc.) is designated as an SNC if it meets specific criteria at origination:
1.  **Aggregate Amount:** The total loan commitment must be **$100 million or more**.
2.  **Shared by Multiple Lenders:** It must be shared by **three or more unaffiliated, federally supervised institutions**.
    *   "Federally supervised institutions" typically include national banks, state member banks, state non-member banks, and savings associations.
    *   "Unaffiliated" means the institutions are not commonly controlled or part of the same holding company.

While the SNC definition focuses on federally supervised institutions, these large syndicated loans are often shared with a broader group of lenders, including U.S. branches of foreign banks, and non-bank financial institutions like investment funds, CLOs, hedge funds, and insurance companies. The regulatory review, however, primarily focuses on the exposures held by the supervised institutions.

**The SNC Review Process:**
*   **Frequency:** SNC reviews are typically conducted semi-annually (though the main public report is annual).
*   **Focus:** Examiners from the FRS, FDIC, and OCC conduct coordinated reviews of these large credits. They assess the credit quality of individual loans, the underwriting standards at origination, and the ongoing risk management practices of the agent banks and participants.
*   **Areas of Emphasis:** The program's reviews often concentrate on areas of heightened or emerging risk, such as leveraged loans, loans to specific industries facing stress (e.g., commercial real estate, energy during price downturns), and trends in loan agreement terms (like covenant-lite structures).
*   **Output:** The findings from the SNC program are aggregated and published in annual reports. These reports provide valuable insights into credit quality trends, risk levels, and underwriting practices across the U.S. banking system, serving as a key barometer of systemic risk in the corporate lending market. For instance, a report might highlight that while overall credit risk remains moderate, leveraged loans (a subset of SNCs) comprise a disproportionately high percentage of "non-pass" (higher-risk) loans.

## 7.2. SNC Classification Criteria: The Regulatory Risk Rating Scale
The core of the SNC program is its uniform risk rating system, which classifies loans based on their perceived credit quality. For a credit analyst working within or with regulated financial institutions, understanding these classifications is vital, as they are the official definitions of credit risk used by U.S. bank regulators. A loan's SNC rating (or an internal rating that maps to these classifications) directly impacts how it is treated for regulatory capital adequacy calculations and loan loss provisioning.

The main classification categories are:

*   **Pass:**
    *   **Definition:** This is the baseline rating for a credit that does not exhibit any significant, identifiable weaknesses and is expected to be fully repaid according to its original contractual terms. The borrower is considered to be financially sound and capable of meeting its obligations.
    *   **Note:** Most internal bank rating systems further differentiate "Pass" grades (e.g., using numerical ratings like 1-5 or 1-7 within the Pass category) to reflect varying levels of strength and very low to moderate risk.

*   **Special Mention (SM):**
    *   **Definition:** This is a critical category that serves as an **official early warning signal**. An SM-rated asset has **potential weaknesses** that, if left uncorrected, could result in a deterioration of the repayment prospects or the lender's credit position in the future. These weaknesses are not yet severe enough to warrant a "classified" rating (Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss), but they require **close management attention and monitoring**.
    *   **Examples of Issues Leading to SM:**
        *   Adverse operating trends (e.g., declining revenues or margins, negative cash flow for a period).
        *   A deteriorating balance sheet (e.g., rising leverage, weakening liquidity).
        *   Ineffective loan agreement terms or covenant breaches that have been waived but signal underlying stress.
        *   Negative industry trends specifically impacting the borrower.
        *   Overreliance on a single source of repayment or a vulnerable business model.
        *   Management issues or lack of a clear strategic direction.

*   **Classified:** This category includes loans with **well-defined weaknesses** where the collection of principal and interest in full, according to the original terms, is in jeopardy. There are three sub-categories of classified assets, reflecting increasing severity of risk:

    *   **1. Substandard:**
        *   **Definition:** A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged (if any). There is a **distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss** if the deficiencies are not corrected.
        *   **Characteristics:** The primary source of repayment may be insufficient, and the bank may have to rely on secondary sources (like collateral liquidation or guarantor support) which may not cover the full exposure.
        *   **Examples of Issues Leading to Substandard:**
            *   Persistent negative operating cash flow.
            *   Sustained losses.
            *   Significant covenant defaults.
            *   A poorly structured loan that relies on uncertain future events for repayment.
            *   Clear impairment of collateral value or perfection.

    *   **2. Doubtful:**
        *   **Definition:** A doubtful asset has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the **collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable** based on currently known conditions.
        *   **Characteristics:** The possibility of loss is high, but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as a "Loss" is deferred until its more exact status can be determined. These pending factors could include a proposed merger, acquisition, refinancing, capital injection, or the perfection of collateral, but their outcome is uncertain.
        *   **Note:** Assets are typically not classified as Doubtful for extended periods.

    *   **3. Loss:**
        *   **Definition:** An asset classified as loss is considered **uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.** This classification does not mean the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value; rather, it means it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may be effected in the future.
        *   **Action Required:** Regulators expect banks to write off (charge-off) assets classified as Loss in the period they are deemed uncollectible.

## 7.3. Implications for Bank Portfolios and Credit Analysts
The SNC ratings assigned to a bank's loan portfolio (or the internal ratings that map to these SNC categories) have significant consequences for the institution:

*   **Loan Loss Provisions (Allowances):**
    *   Banks must maintain an Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL), or under CECL (Current Expected Credit Losses), an Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL), sufficient to cover estimated credit losses in their portfolio.
    *   The aggregate level of **Special Mention and Classified (Substandard, Doubtful, Loss) loans** is a primary driver of the size of this allowance.
    *   Higher volumes of non-pass loans (SM or Classified) will generally require larger provisions, which directly reduce the bank's reported earnings and can impact its capital. Specific provisioning percentages are often internally (and regulatorily) guided by these classifications.

*   **Capital Adequacy:**
    *   Regulators require banks to hold a certain amount of capital (e.g., Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, Total Capital) as a buffer against unexpected losses, relative to their risk-weighted assets (RWA).
    *   The risk profile of the loan portfolio, as indicated by internal and SNC risk ratings, is a key factor in determining the RWA and thus the adequacy of a bank's capital. Higher-risk loans (often those with worse classifications) typically carry higher risk weights, meaning the bank must hold more capital against them.

*   **Risk Management, Monitoring, and Remedial Action:**
    *   A loan's risk rating dictates the level of scrutiny and management attention it receives.
    *   **Higher-risk credits (SM or Classified)** are typically subject to:
        *   More frequent and intensive reviews by credit officers and loan workout specialists.
        *   More detailed financial reporting requirements from the borrower.
        *   More frequent contact with the borrower's management to monitor the situation.
        *   Development of specific action plans to mitigate risk, improve the credit, or manage an exit.
    *   This ensures that management attention and bank resources are focused on the areas of greatest risk within the portfolio. For an analyst, being assigned to monitor or help manage a watch-list or classified credit involves a different level of intensity and often requires different skills than underwriting new, healthy credits.

*   **Regulatory Scrutiny and Enforcement:**
    *   High levels of classified assets or deteriorating trends in SNC ratings can attract increased scrutiny from regulators and may lead to informal or formal enforcement actions if risk management practices are deemed deficient.

Understanding the SNC framework is therefore essential not only for compliance but also for effective credit risk management and for appreciating the broader regulatory context in which large corporate lending occurs.
