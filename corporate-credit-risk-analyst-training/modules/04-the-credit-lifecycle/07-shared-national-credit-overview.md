# Module 7: Shared National Credit (SNC) Overview & Criteria

## 7.1. Understanding the SNC Program
The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program is a crucial component of the U.S. banking regulatory landscape, established in 1977 to ensure a consistent and efficient review of the largest and most complex loans held by multiple financial institutions. The program is governed by an interagency agreement among the three main federal bank regulators: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRS), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

A credit is designated as an SNC if it meets specific criteria: it must be a loan or formal loan commitment aggregating to $100 million or more at origination, and it must be shared by three or more unaffiliated, federally supervised institutions. These large syndicated loans are often shared with a broader group of lenders, including foreign banks and non-bank financial institutions like hedge funds and insurance companies.

The SNC review is conducted semi-annually and focuses on assessing credit risk trends and risk management practices associated with these large credits. The program's reviews often concentrate on areas of heightened risk, such as leveraged loans and borrowers in stressed industry sectors, providing a key barometer of systemic risk in the corporate lending market. The findings from the SNC program, published in annual reports, offer valuable insights into credit quality trends across the banking system. For example, a recent report noted that while overall credit risk remained moderate, leveraged loans comprised nearly half of total SNC commitments but accounted for a disproportionately high 79% of "non-pass" (higher-risk) loans.

## 7.2. SNC Classification Criteria
The core of the SNC program is its uniform risk rating system, which classifies loans based on their credit quality. For a credit analyst, understanding these classifications is vital, as they are the official definitions of credit risk used by regulators. A loan's SNC rating directly impacts how it is treated for regulatory capital and loan loss provisioning purposes.

The main classification categories are:
*   **Pass:** This is the baseline rating for a credit that does not exhibit any significant weaknesses and is expected to be fully repaid according to its terms. Most rating systems further differentiate pass grades to reflect varying levels of strength.
*   **Special Mention (SM):** This is a critical category that serves as an official early warning signal. An SM-rated asset has potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, could result in a deterioration of the repayment prospects or the lender's credit position in the future. These weaknesses are not yet severe enough to warrant a "classified" rating, but they require close management attention. Examples of issues that could lead to an SM rating include adverse operating trends, a deteriorating balance sheet, or ineffective loan agreement terms.
*   **Classified:** This category includes loans with well-defined weaknesses where the collection of principal and interest is in jeopardy. There are three sub-categories of classified assets:
    *   **Substandard:** A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
    *   **Doubtful:** A doubtful asset has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable.
    *   **Loss:** An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This does not mean the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset.

## 7.3. Implications for Bank Portfolios
The SNC ratings assigned to a bank's loan portfolio have significant consequences. These ratings are a key input into the bank's internal risk management processes and its external regulatory reporting.
*   **Loan Loss Provisions:** A bank must set aside an Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) to cover expected credit losses in its portfolio. The aggregate level of classified and special mention loans is a primary driver of the size of this allowance. A higher volume of non-pass loans will require a larger provision, which directly reduces the bank's reported earnings.
*   **Capital Adequacy:** Regulators require banks to hold a certain amount of capital as a buffer against unexpected losses. The risk profile of the loan portfolio, as measured by the SNC ratings, is a key factor in determining the adequacy of a bank's capital. A riskier portfolio will require a larger capital buffer.
*   **Risk Management and Monitoring:** A loan's risk rating dictates the level of scrutiny it receives. Higher-risk credits, particularly those rated Special Mention or worse, are subject to more frequent reviews, more intensive analysis, and more frequent contact with the borrower to monitor the situation and develop action plans. This ensures that management attention and resources are focused on the areas of greatest risk within the portfolio.
