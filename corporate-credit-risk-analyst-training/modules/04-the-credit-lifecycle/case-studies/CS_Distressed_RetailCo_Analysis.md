# Case Study: Distressed RetailCo Analysis

**Module:** 04 - The Credit Lifecycle (Ongoing Credit Monitoring & Potential Restructuring)

**Company:** RetailCo Inc.
**Industry:** Brick-and-Mortar Apparel Retail
**Situation:** RetailCo was once a prominent apparel retailer known for its mid-range fashion and wide network of mall-based stores. Over the past five years, it has faced significant challenges due to the rise of e-commerce, changing consumer preferences, increased competition from fast-fashion brands, and most recently, a global pandemic that led to store closures and reduced foot traffic.

**Credit Facilities:**
*   **Revolving Credit Facility (RCF):** $100 million, currently 90% drawn ($90 million outstanding). Secured by inventory and receivables. Expires in 6 months. Contains a minimum EBITDA covenant (currently in violation) and a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant (expected to be in violation soon).
*   **Term Loan B (TLB):** $310 million outstanding, matures in 3 years. Secured by substantially all assets, pari passu with RCF on current assets. Interest rate L+600.
*   **Public Bonds (Unsecured Notes):** $0 million (RetailCo previously had unsecured notes which were termed out by the TLB). *Correction: Assume $50M in unsecured notes maturing in 4 years to make it more complex, instead of $0. Let's adjust total debt and TLB for this.*

**Corrected Credit Facilities & Debt:**
*   **Revolving Credit Facility (RCF):** $100 million, $90 million outstanding. Secured by inventory and receivables. Expires in 6 months. Covenant issues.
*   **Term Loan B (TLB):** $260 million outstanding ($400M Total Debt - $90M RCF - $50M Unsecured). Matures in 3 years. Secured. Interest L+600.
*   **Unsecured Notes:** $50 million outstanding, mature in 4 years. Current YTM 25% (trading at significant discount).

**Recent Events & Analyst Concerns:**
*   **Covenant Breaches:** RetailCo breached its minimum EBITDA covenant on the RCF last quarter. Lenders issued a waiver but imposed stricter reporting requirements and a forbearance agreement is being negotiated.
*   **Liquidity Crisis:** With only $10 million in cash and negative FCF, the company is struggling to fund operations, purchase inventory for upcoming seasons, and make interest payments. The RCF is nearly fully drawn.
*   **Supplier Issues:** Suppliers are tightening credit terms, demanding cash on delivery or letters of credit, further straining liquidity.
*   **Store Closures:** The company has announced plans to close 50 underperforming stores (out of 300 total) but faces lease termination costs.
*   **Management Turnover:** CFO resigned three months ago; interim CFO appointed. CEO has been with the company for 15 years.
*   **Activist Investor:** A small activist investor has taken a 5% equity stake and is publicly calling for a sale of the company or its assets.
*   **Online Growth vs. Profitability:** While online sales are growing, the costs associated with e-commerce (shipping, returns, digital marketing) are high, and this channel is not yet significantly profitable.

**Key Questions for Credit Analysis (Ongoing Monitoring & Potential Restructuring):**

1.  **Liquidity Assessment:**
    *   What is the company's current liquidity position? How long can it continue to operate without additional funding or significant operational changes (i.e., what is its "cash runway")?
    *   What are the potential sources of short-term liquidity (e.g., asset sales, further RCF draw if possible, DIP financing if Chapter 11 is considered)?
    *   Analyze the terms of the RCF. What are the implications of the covenant breaches?

2.  **Business Viability & Turnaround Prospects:**
    *   Is the core business still viable? Can RetailCo effectively compete in the current retail environment?
    *   What are the key elements of a potential turnaround plan (e.g., further store rationalization, e-commerce optimization, brand repositioning, cost cuts)? How feasible are these?
    *   Evaluate the strength of the management team to execute a turnaround.

3.  **Capital Structure Analysis & Debt Recovery Prospects:**
    *   Analyze the current capital structure. Which debt tranches are most at risk?
    *   What is the estimated recovery for each class of debt (RCF, Term Loan B, Unsecured Notes) in a potential restructuring or liquidation scenario? Consider asset valuations (inventory, receivables, PP&E including store leases, brand value).
    *   What are the security and seniority positions of each debt instrument?

4.  **Restructuring Options:**
    *   What are the likely restructuring options available to RetailCo (e.g., out-of-court workout, Chapter 11 bankruptcy)?
    *   What would be the objectives of key stakeholders in a restructuring (e.g., secured lenders, unsecured noteholders, equity holders, management, suppliers)?
    *   Could a debt-for-equity swap be a possibility? For which tranches?

5.  **Monitoring & Early Warning Signs:**
    *   If you were a lender, what key metrics and qualitative factors would you be monitoring closely going forward?
    *   What were the early warning signs of distress for RetailCo in prior years (T-5 to T-1)?

**Assignment for the Analyst:**

1.  Prepare a brief memo outlining your assessment of RetailCo's credit risk.
2.  Identify the most critical near-term risks (next 6-12 months).
3.  Propose 2-3 key questions you would want to ask RetailCo's management.
4.  What is your preliminary recommendation regarding the existing debt exposure (e.g., hold, sell, engage with company for restructuring talks)? Justify your recommendation.

This case study provides a scenario for analysts to apply skills in financial statement analysis, covenant analysis, liquidity assessment, and preliminary restructuring considerations for a company in distress.Okay, the distressed company case study for Module 4 is created.

Next, I will create the case study on a specialized industry for Module 8. I'll choose the "Pharmaceuticals" industry, focusing on a mid-cap company with a recently approved drug and a pipeline. I'll name it `CS_PharmaCo_Pipeline_Risk_Analysis.md` and place it in the `case-studies` sub-directory within Module 8.
