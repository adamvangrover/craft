*   **Issuer (Borrower):** The entity (e.g., corporation) seeking to borrow funds by issuing debt (loans, bonds).
*   **Loan Application:** A formal request made by a potential borrower to a lender for an extension of credit.
*   **Initial Screening:** A preliminary review of a loan request to determine if it aligns with the lender's basic policies and risk appetite before committing to full due diligence.
*   **Due Diligence:** An in-depth investigation and verification of a potential borrower's business, financial condition, management, industry, and other relevant factors to assess credit risk.
    *   **Financial Due Diligence:** Focuses on analyzing historical and projected financials, quality of earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet strength.
    *   **Business/Commercial Due Diligence:** Examines market position, industry dynamics, competitive advantages, management capabilities, and operational aspects.

    *   **Collateral:** Assets pledged to secure the loan (secondary repayment source).
    *   **Conditions:** Loan terms and the economic/industry environment.

## Conceptual Tools & Frameworks (Beyond this Module's Content)

*   **Due Diligence Request List:** A comprehensive list of documents and information typically requested from a borrower at the outset of the due diligence process. This would be tailored to the specific type of borrower and transaction.
    *   *Categories often include:* Corporate/Legal documents, Historical Financials (audited, interim, tax returns), Projections, Business Plans, Management Info, Customer/Supplier Info, Material Contracts, Insurance, etc.
*   **Management Meeting Question Guide:** A structured list of questions to ask management during due diligence meetings, covering strategy, operations, financial performance, projections, risks, and industry outlook.
*   **Standard Credit Memo Template:** While varying by institution, having a conceptual understanding of a detailed credit memo outline helps in organizing due diligence findings.
    *   (Refer to Module 5 for the structure, but a more granular internal template would exist at a bank).
*   **Financial Model Template for Projections:** (As covered in Module 2). Essential for quantifying repayment capacity.
*   **Collateral Evaluation Checklist:** For secured lending, a checklist to ensure proper valuation, appraisal, lien perfection, and ongoing monitoring of collateral.

*(Note: Effective underwriting combines structured processes with critical judgment and experience. Checklists and templates are tools, not substitutes for thorough analysis.)*
