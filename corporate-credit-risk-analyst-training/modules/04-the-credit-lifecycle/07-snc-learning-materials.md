# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 7 - Shared National Credit (SNC) Overview & Criteria

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 7)

*   **Shared National Credit (SNC) Program:** An interagency program in the U.S. (FRS, FDIC, OCC) established to provide uniform review and classification of large, syndicated loans held by multiple federally supervised institutions.
*   **Syndicated Loan:** A loan extended to a single borrower by a group (syndicate) of lenders who share the credit risk.
*   **Federally Supervised Institutions:** Financial institutions regulated by federal agencies like the Federal Reserve (FRS), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Includes national banks, state member banks, etc.
*   **Unaffiliated Institutions:** Financial institutions that are not commonly controlled or part of the same bank holding company.
*   **Credit Classification (Risk Rating):** The categorization of a loan based on its perceived credit quality and risk of loss. SNC uses a specific classification system.
*   **Pass:** An SNC classification indicating a loan does not exhibit significant weaknesses and is expected to be fully repaid according to its terms.
*   **Special Mention (SM):** An SNC classification for a loan that has potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, could result in future deterioration of repayment prospects. Serves as an early warning.
*   **Classified Loan:** An SNC classification for a loan with well-defined weaknesses where collection of principal and interest is in jeopardy. Subdivided into Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss.
    *   **Substandard:** A classified loan inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or collateral. There's a distinct possibility of some loss if deficiencies aren't corrected.
    *   **Doubtful:** A classified loan with all the weaknesses of Substandard, plus the collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable. Loss is likely but specific pending factors defer the Loss classification.
    *   **Loss:** A classified loan considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. Expected to be charged-off.
*   **Non-Pass Loan:** A term often used to collectively refer to loans classified as Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss.
*   **Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) / Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL):** A reserve account on a bank's balance sheet representing an estimate of expected credit losses in its loan portfolio. SNC classifications heavily influence the adequacy of this reserve.
*   **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA):** Assets held by a bank that are weighted according to their credit risk. Higher-risk loans (often those with worse classifications) typically have higher risk weights, requiring banks to hold more capital against them.
*   **Agent Bank:** The lead financial institution in a syndicated loan that has administrative responsibilities, such as disbursing funds, collecting payments, and distributing information to other lenders in the syndicate.
*   **Leveraged Loans:** Loans made to companies that have significant amounts of existing debt or a poor credit history, often a focus of SNC reviews due to their higher risk profile.

    *   Official overview and links to recent SNC reports.
*   **Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) - Shared National Credit Program:** (Search on OCC.gov for "Shared National Credit Program")
    *   The OCC often publishes the annual interagency SNC report and related materials. For example, the March 2024 report: [https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/shared-national-credit-report/files/shared-national-credit-report-2024.html](https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/shared-national-credit-report/files/shared-national-credit-report-2024.html)
*   **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) - Shared National Credit Program:** (Search on FDIC.gov)
    *   The FDIC also co-publishes the SNC reports and provides related guidance.
*   **Bank Regulators' Handbooks:**
    *   The OCC's "Comptroller's Handbook" series, particularly sections on "Rating Credit Risk" and "Large Exposures," provide detailed guidance that aligns with SNC principles. ([https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/index-comptrollers-handbook.html](https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/index-comptrollers-handbook.html))
    *   Similar examination manuals are available from the Federal Reserve and FDIC.
*   **Financial News Articles:** Publications like The Wall Street Journal, American Banker, and Bloomberg often report on the findings of annual SNC reviews, highlighting trends in leveraged lending and overall credit quality in the banking system.

## Conceptual Discussion Points for Deeper Understanding

*   **Why was the SNC program created?**
    *   Consider the challenges regulators faced before 1977 in ensuring consistent risk assessment of very large loans held by multiple banks across different regulatory jurisdictions. A single large borrower could have its loans rated differently by different banks and different regulators, leading to an inconsistent view of systemic risk.
*   **How does the SNC program interact with a bank's internal risk rating system?**
    *   Banks have their own internal risk rating methodologies (e.g., a 1-10 or 1-14 scale). These internal ratings are typically "mapped" to the regulatory classifications (Pass, SM, Substandard, etc.). The SNC review essentially validates or challenges these internal ratings for the largest shared credits.
*   **What are the potential consequences for a bank if SNC examiners downgrade a significant portion of its shared credits?**
    *   Increased loan loss provisions (reducing earnings).
    *   Need for more regulatory capital (potentially impacting lending capacity or shareholder returns).
    *   Increased regulatory scrutiny, potential Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or Consent Orders requiring corrective actions.
    *   Reputational impact.
*   **How might the trends identified in SNC reports (e.g., concerns about covenant-lite loans, underwriting standards in specific sectors) influence a bank's lending policies or a credit analyst's approach to underwriting new deals?**
    *   Banks might tighten their underwriting standards for sectors highlighted as problematic in SNC reports. Analysts might apply more scrutiny to loan structures or financial projections for borrowers in those sectors.

*(Note: The SNC program is specific to the U.S. regulatory environment, but similar supervisory practices for large exposures exist in other major financial systems.)*
