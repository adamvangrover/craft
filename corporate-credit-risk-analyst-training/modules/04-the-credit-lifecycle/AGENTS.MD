## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 04 - The Credit Lifecycle

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`04-the-credit-lifecycle/`) covers the end-to-end process of managing credit, including:
1.  Shared National Credit (SNC) Program.
2.  Underwriting New Issuers (Due Diligence, Credit Approval).
3.  LBO & M&A Analysis from a credit perspective.
4.  Ongoing Credit Monitoring (Early Warning Signs, Watchlist Management).

The main guide for this module is `README.md`. Content is detailed in lesson files `07-*.md` through `10-*.md`.
Case studies are in the `case-studies/` subdirectory.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** The `07-*.md` to `10-*.md` files and their associated `learning-materials.md` files.
*   **Case Studies:** The `case-studies/` subdirectory currently contains `CS_Distressed_RetailCo_Analysis.md`.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Ensure each stage of the lifecycle is clearly explained with actionable insights for an analyst.
    *   Provide practical examples or mini-scenarios within the lesson files.
    *   The `README.md` for this module has been enhanced; ensure content files align with its expanded descriptions.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **SNC Program:** Clearly define the classification categories (Pass, SM, Substandard, Doubtful, Loss) and their implications.
*   **Underwriting:** Detail the due diligence process (financial, business, legal). Explain the role of a credit committee.
*   **LBO/M&A Analysis:** Focus on the *creditor's perspective* â€“ debt capacity, impact on existing debt, covenant implications, downside risks.
*   **Credit Monitoring:** Emphasize both quantitative and qualitative early warning signs. Explain the purpose and process of watchlist management.
*   **Practical Checklists/Frameworks:** Where appropriate (e.g., due diligence, EWS), refer to or incorporate checklist-style information.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link terms to local CRAFT `GLOSSARY.md` and `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   **SNC:** Link to regulatory bodies if appropriate (OCC, Fed, FDIC).
*   **Underwriting/LBO/M&A:** Link to `Financial_Modeling/` for model construction, `Toolkits_and_Checklists/` for due diligence checklists, and Module 14 (Legal Aspects) for documentation.
*   **Monitoring:** Link to Module 1 & 2 for financial and industry analysis refreshers.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   More case studies for underwriting, LBOs, and EWS/watchlist scenarios.
*   Interactive elements (checklists, simple LBO impact tool).
*   Quizzes for each lesson.
