# CFA Level 3 Practice Essay Exam 3 - Guideline Answers

**Disclaimer:** These are guideline answers. There may be other valid points or ways to structure a response. The key is to address the command words in the question directly.

### Question 1 (12 points)

**Guideline Answer:**

**Part A (4 points)**

The required nominal rate of return is the sum of the spending rate, investment management fees, and the expected inflation rate.

1.  **Spending Rate:**
    *   `Annual Grant / Portfolio Value`
    *   `$20 million / $500 million = 4.0%`

2.  **Required Real Return:**
    *   `Spending Rate + Investment Management Fees`
    *   `4.0% + 0.50% = 4.5%`

3.  **Required Nominal Return (Additive/Arithmetic Method):**
    *   `Required Real Return + Expected Inflation Rate`
    *   `4.5% + 2.5% = 7.0%`

4.  **Required Nominal Return (Geometric/Multiplicative Method - more precise):**
    *   `(1 + Real Return) * (1 + Inflation Rate) - 1`
    *   `(1 + 0.045) * (1 + 0.025) - 1`
    *   `1.045 * 1.025 - 1 = 1.071125 - 1 = 7.11%`

*(Scoring Note: Full points would likely be awarded for either the additive or geometric method, as long as the components are correctly identified and calculated. Showing the formula is best practice.)*

**Part B (5 points)**

**Justification:** The current strategic asset allocation is **not likely** to meet EFA's required nominal return of approximately 7.11%.

**Calculation:**
1.  **Expected Portfolio Return Formula:**
    *   `E(Rp) = (Weight_Equity * Return_Equity) + (Weight_FixedIncome * Return_FixedIncome)`

2.  **Calculate Expected Portfolio Return:**
    *   `E(Rp) = (0.60 * 8.0%) + (0.40 * 3.5%)`
    *   `E(Rp) = 4.8% + 1.4%`
    *   `E(Rp) = 6.2%`

3.  **Compare to Required Return:**
    *   The expected return of the current portfolio (6.2%) is less than the required nominal return calculated in Part A (approx. 7.0% - 7.11%). Therefore, there is an expected shortfall, and the objective is unlikely to be met with the current allocation.

**Part C (3 points)**

A perpetual foundation like EFA may have a higher-than-average risk tolerance because of its **long time horizon**. Since the foundation is intended to exist in perpetuity, it does not have a near-term liability that must be funded on a specific date. This long time horizon allows the endowment to withstand short-term market volatility and invest in higher-risk, less liquid assets with the potential for higher long-term returns, as it has ample time to recover from any potential downturns.

### Question 2 (10 points)

**Guideline Answer:**

**Part A (4 points)**

Two potential benefits of adding private equity to EFA's portfolio, other than higher expected returns, are:

1.  **Diversification Benefits:** Private equity has historically shown low correlation to traditional public equity and fixed-income markets. As stated in the case, the proposed fund has a low correlation to EFA's existing assets. Adding a low-correlation asset can lower the overall portfolio's standard deviation (volatility) and improve its risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio).

2.  **Access to Unique Investment Opportunities / Illiquidity Premium:** Private equity provides access to private companies not available in public markets. This allows the endowment to capture a potential "illiquidity premium," which is the excess return investors demand for holding assets that cannot be easily bought or sold.

**Part B (6 points)**

Two challenges or risks associated with investing in private equity for an endowment like EFA are:

1.  **Illiquidity:** Private equity investments are long-term and highly illiquid, often locking up capital for 7-10 years or more. EFA has a perpetual time horizon, but it still needs to meet its annual spending requirement of $20 million. If a significant portion of the portfolio is tied up in illiquid private equity, it may be difficult to generate sufficient cash to fund the annual grant during a market downturn without selling liquid assets at inopportune times.

2.  **Valuation and Measurement Challenges:** Unlike public securities, private equity investments are not priced daily. Valuations are typically based on internal models, recent financing rounds, or comparable company analysis and are provided quarterly with a lag. This lack of transparency and reliance on appraisal-based values can make it difficult for the board to accurately assess the true market value and risk of its portfolio at any given time. It also complicates performance measurement and risk monitoring.

*(Other valid points could include high fees, commitment risk/capital calls, or the need for specialized due diligence.)*

### Question 3 (8 points)

**Guideline Answer:**

**Part A (4 points)**

**Recommendation:** To reduce the portfolio's sensitivity to rising interest rates, EFA should implement a strategy to **reduce its portfolio's duration**.

**Justification:**
Duration is a measure of a bond portfolio's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. A higher duration implies a larger price decline for a given increase in interest rates. By reducing the overall portfolio duration from its current 7.5 years, the market value of the fixed-income portfolio will be less negatively impacted by a rise in interest rates. This can be achieved by selling longer-maturity bonds and buying shorter-maturity bonds, or by using derivatives like interest rate swaps or shorting bond futures.

**Part B (4 points)**

**Disadvantage:**
A primary disadvantage of reducing portfolio duration is a **lower yield**. Generally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning longer-maturity bonds offer higher yields than shorter-maturity bonds. By shifting the portfolio towards shorter-duration assets, EFA would likely reduce the overall yield and income generated by its fixed-income portfolio. This could create a drag on the portfolio's total return, making it even more difficult to meet the foundation's 7.11% required nominal return objective.
