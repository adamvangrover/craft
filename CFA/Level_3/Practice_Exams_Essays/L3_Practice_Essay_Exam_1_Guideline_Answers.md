## Question 1: Private Wealth Management - IPS and Asset Allocation (Total 45 minutes)

**A. (15 minutes)**
Formulate the **return objective** for the Robertson family's investment portfolio. Show your calculations for any required return component. State the overall return objective clearly.

**Guideline Answer:**

The Robertsons' return objective needs to cover their living expenses, the planned philanthropic donation, account for inflation, and ideally allow for wealth growth for legacy purposes, all while considering their tax situation.

**1. Calculate Annual Spending Needs (Post-Susan's Retirement):**
*   Current annual living expenses: $150,000 (pre-tax)
*   Inflation: 2.5%

**2. Calculate Required Pre-Tax Nominal Return for Living Expenses (once Susan retires in 3 years):**
*   Asset base for generating income: $5,000,000
*   Annual spending from portfolio (pre-tax): $150,000
*   Required return from portfolio for spending = $150,000 / $5,000,000 = 3.0% (nominal, pre-tax, just for spending).
*   To maintain purchasing power, this 3.0% spending rate needs to be adjusted for inflation.
    *   Real required return for spending = `(1 + Nominal Required Return for Spending) / (1 + Inflation) - 1`
        If the $150,000 is a *real* spending need, then the portfolio needs to generate $150,000 in real terms.
    *   Alternatively, the portfolio needs to grow by inflation to maintain the principal in real terms, plus generate the real spending amount.
    *   Required nominal return to cover real spending and preserve capital = `(Spending Rate + Inflation Rate) / (1 - Tax Rate_portfolio)` if spending is after-tax.
    *   Given spending is pre-tax: `Required Nominal Return for spending & inflation = Spending Rate + Inflation Rate = 3.0% + 2.5% = 5.5%`. This ensures the principal grows with inflation and $150k nominal can be withdrawn.

**3. Account for Philanthropic Goal:**
*   Donation: $500,000 in 5 years.
*   This can be treated as a lump-sum withdrawal or by annuitizing its impact on required return.
*   Let's consider its impact on the asset base. If $500,000 is set aside or its growth is specifically targeted, the remaining $4,500,000 then needs to support the $150,000 spending.
    *   New spending rate on remaining assets = $150,000 / $4,500,000 = 3.33%.
    *   New required nominal return for spending & inflation = 3.33% + 2.5% = 5.83%.

**4. Consider Susan's Salary (for next 3 years):**
*   Susan's pre-tax salary: $80,000.
*   For the next 3 years, portfolio only needs to cover: $150,000 - $80,000 = $70,000 of expenses.
    *   Spending rate during these 3 years = $70,000 / $5,000,000 = 1.4%.
    *   Required nominal return (spending & inflation) for first 3 years = 1.4% + 2.5% = 3.9%.

**5. Overall Return Objective Statement:**

The Robertsons have a multi-stage return objective.
*   **Short-term (next 3 years):** The portfolio needs to generate a pre-tax nominal return sufficient to cover $70,000 of annual living expenses and the philanthropic goal, while preserving capital in real terms. A target return of approximately **3.9% to 4.5%** (1.4% spending + 2.5% inflation + small buffer for donation growth/timing) would be appropriate for this period. The philanthropic goal adds a capital appreciation need for a portion of the portfolio.
*   **Long-term (post-Susan's retirement, after donation):** The portfolio (adjusted for the $500k donation) needs to generate a pre-tax nominal return to cover $150,000 of real annual living expenses and allow for potential wealth growth for legacy purposes. This requires a pre-tax nominal return of at least **5.83%** (3.33% real spending + 2.5% inflation on the $4.5M base).
*   **Overall Stated Objective:** "The primary return objective is to generate a pre-tax nominal return that meets their ongoing real spending needs of $150,000 per year (after Susan's retirement), funds a $500,000 philanthropic donation in 5 years, and preserves the portfolio's purchasing power against inflation (2.5%). A secondary objective is long-term growth for legacy purposes, if achievable within their risk tolerance. This translates to a required pre-tax nominal return of approximately 5.5-6.0% on average over the long term, with lower needs in the initial 3 years."

*(Note: A more precise calculation would involve discounting the $500k donation or calculating the required savings rate for it, then determining the return needed on the remaining assets. The above provides a reasoned estimate).*

**B. (15 minutes)**
Formulate the **risk objective** for the Robertson family's investment portfolio. Discuss both their ability and willingness to take risk. State the overall risk tolerance.

**Guideline Answer:**

**Ability to Take Risk:**
*   **Asset Base:** $5,000,000 is substantial relative to their $150,000 annual spending needs (3.0% withdrawal rate initially, rising to 3.33% after donation on reduced base). This suggests a **moderate to above-average ability** to take risk, as the portfolio doesn't need to generate exceptionally high returns to meet basic needs.
*   **Time Horizon:** Multi-stage. Long-term for retirement income (potentially 25-35+ years) and legacy. Shorter term (5 years) for the philanthropic goal. The overall long horizon for a significant portion of assets increases their ability to take risk.
*   **Income Needs:** Currently supplemented by Susan's salary. Post-retirement, portfolio income becomes crucial. The need to fund essential living expenses reduces ability to withstand large capital losses.
*   **Liquidity Needs:** Besides ongoing expenses, the $500,000 donation in 5 years is a significant known liquidity event. An emergency fund should also be considered.
*   **Wealth:** They own their home outright, reducing fixed expenses and providing a safety net, increasing ability.
*   **Overall Ability:** **Moderate.** While the asset base is large and time horizon long, the reliance on the portfolio for long-term living expenses and the specific philanthropic goal temper the ability to take on very high risk.

**Willingness to Take Risk:**
*   **Client Description:** They describe themselves as "moderate." This is a starting point.
*   **David's Concern:** "Concerned about outliving their assets" suggests some risk aversion, particularly towards significant drawdowns or scenarios threatening long-term sustainability. This points to a **below-average to average willingness**.
*   **Susan's Comfort:** "More comfortable with market fluctuations" suggests a potentially **average to above-average willingness**.
*   **Past Experience:** "Previously experienced a 15% portfolio decline without panic" indicates some resilience and suggests their stated moderate willingness is likely genuine, potentially **average**.
*   **Conflicting Views:** The difference between David and Susan needs to be reconciled or managed. Usually, the more conservative view takes precedence or a compromise is found.
*   **Overall Willingness:** Considering David's concerns and their self-assessment, their willingness is likely **average or moderate**. They are not aggressive risk-takers.

**Overall Risk Tolerance:**
The overall risk tolerance should generally be the lower of ability and willingness, or a carefully considered blend if they are close.
*   Ability: Moderate.
*   Willingness: Average/Moderate, perhaps leaning slightly cautious due to David's concerns.
*   **Conclusion on Overall Risk Tolerance:** **Moderate.** The portfolio should aim for steady growth and income generation without exposing the Robertsons to excessive volatility or high probability of significant capital loss, especially concerning the funds needed for their essential living expenses and the near-term philanthropic goal.

**Risk Objective Statement:** "The Robertsons have a moderate overall risk tolerance. The portfolio should be managed to balance the need for long-term growth and inflation protection with the desire to avoid significant drawdowns that could jeopardize their retirement security or philanthropic goals. While they have a good ability to take some market risk due to their asset base and long time horizon for a portion of their assets, their willingness, particularly David's, is more aligned with a moderate approach. Volatility should be managed, and strategies with a high probability of large losses should be avoided."

**C. (15 minutes)**
Identify and briefly justify **three specific constraints** (other than risk and return) that should be considered when developing the Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for the Robertsons. For each constraint, explain its implication for asset allocation.

**Guideline Answer:**

1.  **Liquidity:**
    *   **Justification:** The Robertsons have two primary liquidity needs: (1) an ongoing need for cash to supplement living expenses, especially after Susan retires (though initially covered by the 3% withdrawal rate), and (2) a specific lump-sum requirement of $500,000 for their philanthropic donation in 5 years. An emergency fund should also be considered.
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** A portion of the portfolio must be allocated to liquid, low-risk assets (e.g., cash, short-term bonds) to meet the upcoming $500,000 donation without forced selling of less liquid or volatile assets at an inopportune time. An emergency fund (e.g., 3-6 months of living expenses) should also be held in liquid assets. This reduces the overall allocation to higher-risk, less liquid growth assets.

2.  **Time Horizon:**
    *   **Justification:** The Robertsons have a multi-stage time horizon. The philanthropic goal has a 5-year horizon. Their retirement income needs have a long horizon (potentially 25-35+ years). Legacy goals have a very long, intergenerational horizon.
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** The asset allocation should reflect these different horizons. Assets earmarked for the 5-year donation should be invested more conservatively (e.g., shorter-duration bonds, cash equivalents) as the date approaches. The portion of the portfolio supporting long-term retirement and legacy goals can have a higher allocation to growth assets like equities, as there is more time to recover from potential downturns. This might suggest a "goals-based" or "time-segmented" approach to asset allocation.

3.  **Tax Concerns:**
    *   **Justification:** The entire $5,000,000 investable asset base is in taxable accounts. They are subject to a 30% marginal income tax rate and a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate.
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** The asset allocation and investment strategy should be tax-efficient. This includes:
        *   Favoring investments that generate long-term capital gains over those generating highly taxed ordinary income (where appropriate for risk/return objectives).
        *   Considering tax-exempt municipal bonds if their after-tax yield is competitive.
        *   Implementing tax-loss harvesting strategies.
        *   Managing turnover to minimize realization of short-term capital gains.
        *   Asset location is not relevant here as all assets are taxable, but if they had tax-advantaged accounts, it would be.

## Question 2: Behavioral Finance and Portfolio Construction (Total 30 minutes)

**A. (10 minutes)**
Identify and describe **two behavioral biases** that Mr. Lee *most likely* exhibits. Justify your choices based on the information provided.

**Guideline Answer:**

1.  **Overconfidence Bias:**
    *   **Description:** Mr. Lee exhibits overconfidence bias, which is an unwarranted faith in one's own intuitive reasoning, judgments, and cognitive abilities. He describes himself as a "savvy investor" who trades based on his "good feel for the market." This suggests he believes his judgment and intuition are superior.
    *   **Justification:** His belief in his "good feel" and self-description as "savvy," coupled with active trading, points to an overestimation of his ability to predict market movements and select winning stocks. His portfolio heavily concentrated in a few tech stocks that performed well *historically* might reinforce this overconfidence (self-attribution bias could also be at play, attributing success to skill).

2.  **Disposition Effect (a manifestation of Loss Aversion and potentially Regret Aversion):**
    *   **Description:** The disposition effect is the tendency for investors to sell winning investments too early and hold onto losing investments too long. Mr. Lee "rarely sells any stock for a loss, preferring to 'wait for it to come back.'"
    *   **Justification:** His reluctance to realize losses by selling underperforming stocks, hoping they will recover, is a classic symptom of the disposition effect. This is often driven by loss aversion (the pain of a realized loss is greater than the pleasure of an equivalent gain) and regret aversion (avoiding the regret of crystallizing a loss).

*(Other potential biases with justification could include: Confirmation Bias - "reads news and research that supports his existing investment choices." Representativeness Bias - concentration in tech stocks that performed well recently, possibly extrapolating past success. Self-Attribution Bias - if he attributes past tech stock success solely to his skill.)*

**B. (10 minutes)**
Explain how each of the two biases identified in Part A could adversely affect Mr. Lee's investment decision-making and portfolio outcomes.

**Guideline Answer:**

1.  **Overconfidence Bias - Adverse Effects:**
    *   **Excessive Trading:** Believing he can time the market or pick winners consistently can lead to frequent trading, incurring higher transaction costs that erode returns.
    *   **Under-diversification:** His heavy concentration in a few tech stocks suggests he might be underestimating the risks associated with a lack of diversification. If these few stocks or the tech sector underperform, his portfolio could suffer significant losses.
    *   **Underestimation of Risk:** Overconfidence can lead to taking on more risk than is appropriate for his overall financial situation or stated goals (if any). He might ignore warning signs or fail to properly assess downside potential.

2.  **Disposition Effect - Adverse Effects:**
    *   **Holding Losers Too Long:** By not selling losing stocks, Mr. Lee allows poor investments to potentially decline further, magnifying losses. Capital remains tied up in underperforming assets instead of being reallocated to better opportunities. This can lead to a portfolio of "weeds" (losers) rather than "flowers" (winners).
    *   **Selling Winners Too Soon (Implied):** While not explicitly stated he sells winners too soon, the disposition effect often includes this component. If so, he might be cutting short the potential gains from his successful investments.
    *   **Tax Inefficiency:** Holding onto losers means not realizing tax losses that could offset capital gains, leading to a higher tax burden than necessary.

**C. (10 minutes)**
Recommend **one specific action or strategy** for each of the two identified biases that you, as his advisor, could suggest to Mr. Lee to help him mitigate the negative effects of these biases.

**Guideline Answer:**

1.  **Mitigating Overconfidence Bias:**
    *   **Action/Strategy: Implement a structured investment decision-making process with clear buy/sell disciplines and maintain detailed records of trades and the reasoning behind them.**
    *   **Explanation:** Encourage Mr. Lee to document his investment thesis for each stock, including specific price targets or conditions for selling (both for profit-taking and cutting losses). Regularly reviewing the outcomes of his decisions against his initial reasoning, including both successes and failures, can provide objective feedback on his actual skill versus perceived skill. This helps calibrate his confidence levels and can reduce impulsive trading based on "feel." Comparing his portfolio's risk-adjusted performance to appropriate benchmarks over time can also provide a more objective measure of success.

2.  **Mitigating Disposition Effect:**
    *   **Action/Strategy: Establish pre-determined sell-discipline rules, such as setting stop-loss orders or price targets for both gains and losses *at the time of purchase*.**
    *   **Explanation:** By setting objective sell criteria before emotional attachment or the pain of a loss influences decisions, Mr. Lee can make more rational sell decisions. For example, a rule could be to sell a stock if it declines by a certain percentage (e.g., 15-20%) from its purchase price or peak value. This helps to cut losses before they become too large. Similarly, having price targets for taking profits can help avoid holding on indefinitely or selling too soon based on emotion. Regularly reviewing the rationale for holding each stock, especially losers, against its original investment thesis can also help overcome the inertia of holding on.

## Question 3: Fixed Income Portfolio Management - Immunization (Total 35 minutes)

**A. (10 minutes)**
Calculate the present value and Macaulay duration of the liability.

**Guideline Answer:**

**Present Value of Liability (PV_L):**
Liability: $10,000,000 due in 7 years.
Market yield (r_cc): 4.0% per annum, continuously compounded.
`PV_L = FV_L * e^(-r_cc * T)`
`PV_L = $10,000,000 * e^(-0.04 * 7)`
`PV_L = $10,000,000 * e^(-0.28)`
`PV_L = $10,000,000 * 0.7557837` (Using e^-0.28 ≈ 0.7557837)
`PV_L = $7,557,837`

**Macaulay Duration of Liability (MacDur_L):**
For a single zero-coupon liability, its Macaulay duration is equal to its time to maturity.
`MacDur_L = 7 years.`

*(Note: If the yield was BEY or annually compounded, the PV formula and MacDur interpretation might need slight adjustment, but continuous compounding is given).*
For continuously compounded rates, Macaulay Duration = `Σ [t * PV(CF_t)] / Σ PV(CF_t)`.
For a zero-coupon bond, there's only one cash flow at time T.
`MacDur_L = [T * PV(CF_T)] / PV(CF_T) = T`.
So, `MacDur_L = 7 years.`

**B. (15 minutes)**
Determine the dollar amount that should be invested in Bond A and Bond B, respectively, to construct a portfolio that immunizes the liability against small parallel shifts in the yield curve. Show your calculations.

**Guideline Answer:**

To immunize, the asset portfolio must satisfy:
1.  `PV(Assets) = PV(Liability) = $7,557,837`
2.  `MacDur(Assets) = MacDur(Liability) = 7 years`

Let `w_A` be the weight (based on market value) invested in Bond A, and `w_B` be the weight in Bond B.
`w_A + w_B = 1`.
Macaulay Duration of Bond A (zero-coupon) = `Dur_A = 5 years`.
Macaulay Duration of Bond B (zero-coupon) = `Dur_B = 10 years`.

Portfolio Duration: `MacDur_P = w_A * Dur_A + w_B * Dur_B`
`7 = w_A * 5 + w_B * 10`
Substitute `w_B = 1 - w_A`:
`7 = 5*w_A + 10*(1 - w_A)`
`7 = 5*w_A + 10 - 10*w_A`
`7 = 10 - 5*w_A`
`5*w_A = 10 - 7 = 3`
`w_A = 3 / 5 = 0.6` (or 60%)

So, `w_B = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4` (or 40%).

**Dollar Amounts:**
Total PV of Assets needed = $7,557,837.
*   Amount in Bond A = `w_A * PV(Assets) = 0.60 * $7,557,837 = $4,534,702.20`
*   Amount in Bond B = `w_B * PV(Assets) = 0.40 * $7,557,837 = $3,023,134.80`

Check: `$4,534,702.20 + $3,023,134.80 = $7,557,837.00`. (Matches PV_L).
Check duration: `0.6 * 5 + 0.4 * 10 = 3.0 + 4.0 = 7 years`. (Matches Dur_L).

**Therefore, invest $4,534,702.20 in Bond A and $3,023,134.80 in Bond B.**

**C. (10 minutes)**
Describe **two conditions**, beyond matching present values and Macaulay durations, that should ideally be met for effective immunization against interest rate risk, particularly for non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. Briefly explain why one of these conditions might be difficult to fully satisfy with only Bond A and Bond B.

**Guideline Answer:**

Two additional conditions for effective immunization, especially against non-parallel shifts:

1.  **Convexity of Assets should be greater than or equal to Convexity of Liabilities (`Conv_A >= Conv_L`):**
    *   **Description:** Convexity measures the rate of change of duration as interest rates change. Higher convexity means that for a given duration, the portfolio will gain more when rates fall and lose less when rates rise compared to a portfolio with lower convexity. Matching duration immunizes against small parallel shifts, but convexity helps protect against larger shifts and some non-parallel shifts (like twists). For a single zero-coupon liability, its convexity is positive. The asset portfolio should aim to have slightly more convexity to provide a buffer.
    *   **Why difficult with Bond A & Bond B:** A portfolio of two zero-coupon bonds (a barbell strategy) will generally have higher convexity than a single zero-coupon liability with a duration equal to the portfolio's duration (which is the case here, as the liability is a 7-year zero). So, this condition (`Conv_A > Conv_L`) *can* generally be met and is a strength of using a barbell of zeros to immunize a single zero liability. The difficulty is not in achieving higher convexity, but rather that simple duration matching alone isn't enough for *all* non-parallel shifts.

2.  **Minimization of Asset Cash Flow Dispersion around Liability Cash Flow(s) / Narrow Range of Asset Cash Flow Dates Relative to Liability Dates:**
    *   **Description:** The asset portfolio's cash flows should be structured to occur as close as possible in timing to the liability cash flow(s). Large dispersion in asset cash flow timing relative to liability timing increases vulnerability to non-parallel yield curve shifts (reinvestment risk and price risk from different parts of the curve moving differently). For a single liability, this means the asset cash flows should ideally bracket the liability date closely.
    *   **Why difficult with Bond A (5yr) & Bond B (10yr) for a 7yr liability:** The liability is at 7 years. The asset portfolio consists of a 5-year zero and a 10-year zero. This is a barbell structure. While it achieves the duration target and likely good convexity, the cash flows from the assets (at year 5 and year 10) do not closely bracket or match the single liability cash flow at year 7. There's a significant gap. This makes the portfolio more susceptible to changes in the yield curve shape (e.g., if the 5-7 year spread or 7-10 year spread changes significantly). Reinvestment of the proceeds from Bond A at year 5 until year 7, and the discounting of the need for funds for Bond B from year 10 back to year 7, both depend on interest rates over those specific future periods, which may not move in line with the overall parallel shift assumption of duration. A portfolio with zeros maturing closer to year 7 (e.g., a 6-year and an 8-year zero) would have less dispersion and provide better immunization against non-parallel shifts, though it might be harder to achieve the exact duration target or might have less convexity.

*(Self-correction on point 1's "difficulty": The question asks why one condition might be difficult to *fully satisfy*. While Conv_A > Conv_L is achievable with a barbell, the *perfect* immunization against *all* non-parallel shifts is the difficulty. The dispersion point is more directly a difficulty with *this specific A and B bond combination* for a 7-year liability).*
