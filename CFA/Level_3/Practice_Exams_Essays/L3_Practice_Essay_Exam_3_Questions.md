## Case Scenario: The Endowment for the Arts (EFA)

The Endowment for the Arts (EFA) is a perpetual foundation established to support artistic and cultural initiatives. Its current market value is $500 million. The EFA's charter requires it to make a significant annual grant to a major cultural festival, which is expected to be $20 million next year and grow with inflation thereafter. The foundation's board has set a primary objective to maintain the real (inflation-adjusted) value of the portfolio in perpetuity, after all expenses and grants.

**EFA Portfolio and Financial Data:**
*   Current Portfolio Value: $500 million
*   Expected Annual Grant (Year 1): $20 million
*   Annual Investment Management Fees: 0.50% (50 basis points)
*   Expected Long-Term Inflation Rate: 2.5% per year

The EFA's Investment Policy Statement (IPS) specifies a strategic asset allocation of 60% global equities and 40% global fixed income. The board is considering adding alternative investments to the portfolio to enhance returns and provide diversification.

**Proposed Alternative Investment:**
A private equity fund-of-funds with an expected nominal return of 12% and a standard deviation of 20%. The board's consultant estimates that adding this asset would have a low correlation (0.20) with the existing equity portfolio and a near-zero correlation (0.05) with the fixed income portfolio.
