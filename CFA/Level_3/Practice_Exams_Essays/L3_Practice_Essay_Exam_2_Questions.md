# CFA Level 3 Practice Essay Exam 2: Questions

## Case Scenario 1: The Chen Family Endowment (Asset Allocation, IPS)

The Chen Family Endowment (CFE) was established ten years ago by David Chen with an initial contribution of $50 million. The endowment's primary long-term objective is to provide stable, inflation-adjusted support for various charitable activities, currently requiring an annual spending distribution of $2.5 million. CFE's Investment Policy Statement (IPS) specifies a long-term return objective of achieving this spending goal plus covering inflation and investment management fees, while maintaining the real value of the endowment's assets. Inflation is expected to average 2.5% annually, and investment management fees are 0.5% annually.

CFE's current strategic asset allocation (SAA) and long-term capital market expectations are provided below:

| Asset Class         | Current SAA | Expected Return | Expected Std. Dev. | Expected Correlation with Global Equities |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Global Equities     | 60%         | 8.5%            | 18.0%              | 1.00                                      |
| Global Fixed Income | 30%         | 3.5%            | 6.0%               | 0.10                                      |
| Real Estate         | 10%         | 6.0%            | 12.0%              | 0.50                                      |
| Cash                | 0%          | 1.0%            | 0.5%               | 0.00                                      |

The CFE board is considering two alternative asset classes for potential inclusion in the SAA:
1.  **Private Equity:** Expected Return 11.0%, Expected Std. Dev. 25.0%, Correlation with Global Equities 0.70.
2.  **Commodities:** Expected Return 5.0%, Expected Std. Dev. 20.0%, Correlation with Global Equities 0.20.

The board is concerned about the endowment's ability to meet its objectives given the current market outlook. They are also reviewing the spending policy. The current spending rate is 5% of the prior year-end market value ($2.5 million / $50 million initial, assuming current value is still $50M for this calculation).

**A. Calculate** the endowment's required rate of return based on its stated objectives. Show your calculations. (4 minutes)

**B. Evaluate** whether the current SAA is likely to meet the endowment's required rate of return calculated in Part A. Show your calculations. (6 minutes)

**C. Discuss** two advantages and two disadvantages of including Private Equity in CFE's SAA. (6 minutes)

**D. Recommend and justify** one change to CFE's spending policy that the board should consider to improve the long-term sustainability of the endowment. (4 minutes)

## Case Scenario 2: Behavioral Finance and Portfolio Advice for Ms. Anya Sharma (Behavioral Finance, Private Wealth)

Ms. Anya Sharma, age 60, is a recently retired executive. She has a well-funded retirement portfolio of $5 million, managed by her long-time advisor, Kenji Tanaka, CFA. Ms. Sharma has always described herself as a "conservative investor" but has also expressed frustration when her portfolio underperformed broad market rallies. Her primary goal is to maintain her current lifestyle throughout retirement, which requires an annual withdrawal of $200,000 (4% of current portfolio value). She has a strong desire to leave a significant legacy for her grandchildren.

During a recent review, Ms. Sharma expressed concern about recent market volatility. She mentioned a news article highlighting the success of a tech-focused fund and suggested Tanaka allocate a portion of her portfolio to it. She also showed Tanaka a detailed spreadsheet she created, tracking the performance of several individual stocks she has been "watching" and believes are poised for a turnaround, despite their poor recent performance. She is reluctant to sell any of her existing holdings that have declined in value, stating, "I need to wait for them to recover."

Tanaka notes the following observations about Ms. Sharma:
*   She often refers to specific market events that are recent and widely publicized.
*   She tends to focus on information that supports her existing ideas about investments.
*   She is very proud of her past successful investment picks, even if they were few.

**A. Identify and describe** two cognitive biases Ms. Sharma is exhibiting. Justify your selections based on the case facts. (6 minutes)

**B. Identify and describe** one emotional bias Ms. Sharma is exhibiting. Justify your selection based on the case facts. (4 minutes)

**C. Recommend and justify** one action Tanaka could take to address *each* of the three biases identified in Parts A and B when advising Ms. Sharma on her portfolio. (9 minutes)

**D. Formulate** a two-part investment objective for Ms. Sharma's IPS, covering both her return requirement and risk tolerance, incorporating behavioral considerations. (5 minutes)

## Case Scenario 3: Fixed Income Portfolio Management (Yield Curve Strategies, Credit Risk)

Global Investment Managers (GIM) manages a $500 million fixed income portfolio for a pension fund client. The client's IPS specifies a duration target of 5.0 years and a high credit quality mandate (average A rating or better). The current benchmark is the Global Aggregate Bond Index.

Leo Maxwell, CFA, is the lead portfolio manager. The GIM research team currently has the following views:
1.  **Interest Rates:** They expect the overall level of global interest rates to remain stable in the short term, but anticipate a slight steepening of the yield curve in major developed markets (i.e., long-term rates rising more than short-term rates, or short-term rates falling more than long-term rates).
2.  **Credit Spreads:** They believe investment-grade credit spreads are currently fair but anticipate some widening in lower-rated BBB corporate bonds due to concerns about slowing economic growth.

The current portfolio has a duration of 4.8 years and an average credit rating of A+. Maxwell is considering several strategies:

*   **Strategy 1 (Duration Management):** Adjust the portfolio duration to align with the IPS target.
*   **Strategy 2 (Yield Curve Positioning):** Implement a strategy based on the yield curve steepening view.
*   **Strategy 3 (Credit Relative Value):** Exploit the view on BBB-rated corporate bond spreads.

**A. Describe** how Maxwell should adjust the portfolio's duration to meet the IPS target (Strategy 1) and **state** one specific action he could take to achieve this. (4 minutes)

**B. Recommend and justify** a yield curve strategy for Maxwell to implement based on GIM's view (Strategy 2). Describe one specific way to implement this strategy. (6 minutes)

**C. Evaluate** the appropriateness of a strategy to underweight BBB-rated corporate bonds relative to higher-rated A or AA corporate bonds, given GIM's view (Strategy 3) and the client's IPS. (5 minutes)

**D. Explain** what Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) measures and why it is a useful metric when evaluating bonds with embedded options for inclusion in GIM's portfolio. (5 minutes)
