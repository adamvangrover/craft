**Scenario for Question 1:**

John and Susan Robertson, ages 58 and 55 respectively, are new clients. John recently sold his business for $6 million (after-tax) and has just retired. Susan plans to continue working as a marketing manager for another 3 years, earning a pre-tax salary of $80,000 per year. They have an additional $2 million in various investment accounts, primarily in publicly traded stocks and bonds, bringing their total investable assets to $8,000,000, all held in taxable accounts. They own their primary residence outright (valued at $1.5 million) and have no outstanding debts.

Their current annual living expenses are $180,000 (pre-tax), which they expect to maintain in real terms throughout retirement. They also wish to make a $500,000 philanthropic donation to their alma mater in 5 years. They have two financially independent adult children and would like to leave a reasonable legacy if possible. They describe their overall risk tolerance as "moderate." John is particularly concerned about outliving their assets, while Susan is more comfortable with market fluctuations. They once experienced a 15% portfolio decline during a market downturn without panicking. Assume an expected annual inflation rate of 2.5%. Their marginal income tax rate is 30%, and their long-term capital gains tax rate is 15%.

**Question 1 (Total 45 minutes)**

A.  Formulate the **return objective** for the Robertson family's investment portfolio. Show your calculations for any required return component. State the overall return objective clearly.
    **(15 minutes)**

B.  Formulate the **risk objective** for the Robertson family's investment portfolio. Discuss both their ability and willingness to take risk. State the overall risk tolerance.
    **(15 minutes)**

C.  Identify and briefly justify **three specific constraints** (other than risk and return) that should be considered when developing the Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for the Robertsons. For each constraint, explain its implication for asset allocation.
    **(15 minutes)**

<!--
    TEACHER NOTE for Question 1:
    This question tests core private wealth management IPS construction.
    Part A (Return): Emphasize distinguishing between required and desired returns, accounting for inflation, spending needs (and changes due to retirement), and specific goals like the donation. Students often struggle with multi-stage return objectives.
    Part B (Risk): Stress the importance of assessing BOTH ability and willingness. Highlight how to synthesize potentially conflicting information (e.g., John's concern vs. Susan's comfort) into an overall risk tolerance. Discuss how specific goals (like the donation) can also impact risk capacity for certain tranches of capital.
    Part C (Constraints): Focus on the standard constraints (LLTTU - Liquidity, Legal, Time Horizon, Taxes, Unique Circumstances). Ensure students not only identify but also justify the constraint based on case facts AND explain its implication for asset allocation. Common mistake: just listing a constraint without explaining its impact.
-->
<!--
    STUDENT NOTE for Question 1:
    For IPS questions, structure is key.
    Return Objective: Clearly show calculations for spending, inflation, and any specific goals. State if returns are nominal/real, pre/post-tax.
    Risk Objective: Address ability (asset base, time horizon, liquidity needs vs. assets) and willingness (stated tolerance, past behavior, client comments) separately before concluding on an overall tolerance.
    Constraints: Use the LLTTU mnemonic if helpful. For each constraint, link it directly to case facts and then explicitly state how it would affect investment choices (e.g., "High liquidity need for donation means X% should be in cash/short-term bonds").

**Scenario for Question 2:**

Michael Lee, age 45, is a successful software engineer who considers himself a "savvy investor." He actively manages his own substantial portfolio, which is heavily concentrated in three technology stocks that have performed exceptionally well over the past five years. Lee states he has a "good feel for the market" and often makes trading decisions based on this intuition. He rarely sells any stock for a loss, preferring to "wait for it to come back." He primarily reads news and research that supports his existing investment choices.

---

**Question 2 (Total 30 minutes)**

A.  Identify and describe **two behavioral biases** that Mr. Lee *most likely* exhibits. Justify your choices based on the information provided.
    **(10 minutes)**

B.  Explain how each of the two biases identified in Part A could adversely affect Mr. Lee's investment decision-making and portfolio outcomes.
    **(10 minutes)**

C.  Recommend **one specific action or strategy** for each of the two identified biases that you, as his advisor, could suggest to Mr. Lee to help him mitigate the negative effects of these biases.
    **(10 minutes)**

<!--
    TEACHER NOTE for Question 2:
    This question tests Behavioral Finance.
    Part A (Identify & Describe): Students must not only name the bias but also describe its characteristics and explicitly link it to statements or behaviors from the vignette. Common mistake: naming a bias without sufficient justification from the case.
    Part B (Adverse Effects): Students should explain the negative consequences of the identified biases on portfolio construction, risk management, and returns.
    Part C (Mitigation): Recommendations should be practical and tailored to the specific biases. Distinguish between moderating cognitive errors and adapting to emotional biases.
-->
<!--
    STUDENT NOTE for Question 2:
    Behavioral finance questions often require careful reading of the vignette to pick up clues about the investor's psychology.
    Part A: When justifying a bias, quote or directly reference parts of the scenario.
    Part B: Think about how these biases lead to suboptimal decisions (e.g., too much/little risk, poor diversification, excessive trading, holding losers).
    Part C: For mitigation, consider if the bias is cognitive (can be moderated with better information/process) or emotional (may need to be adapted to). Be specific in your recommendations.

**Scenario for Question 3:**

A defined benefit pension plan has a single liability of $10,000,000 due in 7 years. The current market yield for discounting this liability is 4.0% per annum, continuously compounded. The plan sponsor wishes to immunize this liability using only two available zero-coupon bonds:
*   Bond A: Matures in 5 years.
*   Bond B: Matures in 10 years.

---

**Question 3 (Total 35 minutes)**

A.  Calculate the present value and Macaulay duration of the liability.
    **(10 minutes)**

B.  Determine the dollar amount that should be invested in Bond A and Bond B, respectively, to construct a portfolio that immunizes the liability against small parallel shifts in the yield curve. Show your calculations.
    **(15 minutes)**

C.  Describe **two conditions**, beyond matching present values and Macaulay durations, that should ideally be met for effective immunization against interest rate risk, particularly for non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. Briefly explain why one of these conditions might be difficult to fully satisfy with only Bond A and Bond B for this specific liability.
    **(10 minutes)**

<!--
    TEACHER NOTE for Question 3:
    This question tests Fixed Income portfolio management, specifically immunization.
    Part A (PV & Duration of Liability): Ensure students use the correct discounting method (continuous compounding given). For a zero-coupon liability, Macaulay duration is simply its maturity.
    Part B (Immunization Portfolio): This requires setting up and solving a system of two equations: PV(Assets) = PV(Liability) and Dur(Assets) = Dur(Liability). Students often make algebraic errors or misinterpret weights.
    Part C (Conditions for Immunization): Key concepts are matching convexity (Asset Convexity >= Liability Convexity) and minimizing cash flow dispersion. Students should explain why these are important for non-parallel shifts and how the specific bond choices (5yr and 10yr zeros for a 7yr liability) present a challenge for the dispersion condition.
-->
<!--
    STUDENT NOTE for Question 3:
    Immunization questions are common.
    Part A: Pay close attention to the compounding frequency given for yield. For a single zero-coupon liability, MacDur = Time to Maturity.
    Part B: Clearly define your weights (wA, wB). Set up the two simultaneous equations:
        1) PV_A * wA + PV_B * wB = PV_L (but since weights are based on PV, it's simpler: wA + wB = 1, and the total portfolio PV must equal PV_L).
        2) Dur_A * wA + Dur_B * wB = Dur_L.
       Solve for wA and wB, then calculate dollar amounts.
    Part C: Remember that duration matching only protects against small, parallel shifts. For broader protection, consider convexity and cash flow matching/dispersion. Think about what makes a barbell portfolio (like this one) good for convexity but potentially bad for certain types of non-parallel shifts if the liability is between the barbell points.
