# CFA Level 3 Practice Essay Exam 2: Guideline Answers

## Case Scenario 1: The Chen Family Endowment (Asset Allocation, IPS)

**A. Calculate the endowment's required rate of return.** (4 minutes)

The endowment's required rate of return needs to cover:
1.  Annual spending distribution
2.  Inflation
3.  Investment management fees

*   **Spending Rate:** $2.5 million annual spending / $50 million initial asset base = 5.0%
    *   *(Note: If current market value is different, spending rate based on current value would be used if policy is % of market value. Here, it's stated as a fixed $2.5M initial need, but also linked to 5% of initial. For required return, we use the %.)*
*   **Inflation:** 2.5%
*   **Investment Management Fees:** 0.5%

**Required Nominal Rate of Return** = Spending Rate + Inflation + Fees
= 5.0% + 2.5% + 0.5%
= **8.0%**

Alternatively, using the additive approach for preserving real value:
Required Real Return = Spending Rate + Fees = 5.0% + 0.5% = 5.5%
Required Nominal Return = (1 + Real Return) * (1 + Inflation) - 1
= (1 + 0.055) * (1 + 0.025) - 1
= (1.055 * 1.025) - 1
= 1.081375 - 1 = 0.081375 or **8.14%** (This is the more precise method).

*(Examiner notes: Full credit for either 8.0% with formula shown or 8.14% with formula shown. The additive 8.0% is often accepted as a close approximation.)*

**B. Evaluate whether the current SAA is likely to meet the endowment's required rate of return.** (6 minutes)

First, calculate the expected return of the current SAA:
Expected Portfolio Return = Î£ (Weight_i * Expected Return_i)
= (0.60 * 8.5%) + (0.30 * 3.5%) + (0.10 * 6.0%) + (0.00 * 1.0%)
= (0.051) + (0.0105) + (0.006) + (0)
= 0.0675 or **6.75%**

**Evaluation:**
The current SAA's expected return is 6.75%.
The endowment's required nominal rate of return is approximately 8.0% (or 8.14%).

Since the expected return of the current SAA (6.75%) is less than the required rate of return (approx. 8.0% - 8.14%), the current SAA is **not likely** to meet the endowment's long-term objectives of covering spending, inflation, and fees while preserving the real value of assets. There is an expected shortfall.

**C. Discuss two advantages and two disadvantages of including Private Equity in CFE's SAA.** (6 minutes)

**Advantages of Including Private Equity:**

1.  **Potential for Higher Returns (Return Enhancement):** Private equity offers an expected return of 11.0%, which is higher than any asset class currently in the SAA (Global Equities at 8.5%). This could help close the gap between the current SAA's expected return and the endowment's required return.
2.  **Diversification Benefits (Potentially):** While the correlation with global equities is relatively high (0.70), it is still less than 1.00. Adding private equity could offer some diversification benefits, potentially improving the portfolio's risk-adjusted return, especially if its return drivers are different from public equities over the long term.

**Disadvantages of Including Private Equity:**

1.  **Illiquidity:** Private equity investments are typically illiquid, with capital locked up for many years (e.g., 7-10 years or more). This could be a concern for an endowment that needs to make annual spending distributions, although CFE's spending is currently covered by income/returns from more liquid assets.
2.  **Higher Risk and Complexity (Due Diligence):** Private equity has a higher expected standard deviation (25.0%) than existing asset classes, increasing overall portfolio volatility. It also requires specialized due diligence to select skilled managers (manager selection risk is high) and understand complex fund structures and valuation methodologies.

**D. Recommend and justify one change to CFE's spending policy.** (4 minutes)

**Recommendation:**
The board should consider adopting a **smoothing rule** for its spending policy, such as using a moving average of past portfolio market values (e.g., 3-year or 5-year average) to calculate the annual spending amount, instead of relying on the prior year-end market value.

**Justification:**
A smoothing rule helps to:
1.  **Reduce Volatility of Distributions:** It dampens the impact of short-term market fluctuations on the annual spending amount. This provides more stable and predictable funding for the charitable activities CFE supports.
2.  **Protect Real Value During Market Downturns:** By not forcing distributions based on a potentially temporarily depressed market value (if using prior year-end), it helps preserve capital during down markets, contributing to the long-term sustainability and real value preservation of the endowment. Conversely, it also prevents overspending after a sharp market rally.

## Case Scenario 2: Behavioral Finance and Portfolio Advice for Ms. Anya Sharma

**A. Identify and describe two cognitive biases Ms. Sharma is exhibiting.** (6 minutes)

1.  **Availability Bias (specifically Recency and Vividness):**
    *   *Description:* Ms. Sharma is influenced by a recent news article highlighting a successful tech fund and suggests allocating to it. This indicates she is giving undue weight to information that is easily recalled, recent, and likely vivid due to media attention.
    *   *Justification:* Her suggestion for the tech fund is directly linked to a "news article," a recent and accessible piece of information, rather than a thorough analysis of its suitability for her conservative profile or long-term goals. Her concern about "recent market volatility" also points to the influence of recent events.

2.  **Confirmation Bias:**
    *   *Description:* Ms. Sharma created a spreadsheet tracking stocks she "believes are poised for a turnaround" despite their poor recent performance. This suggests she is likely seeking out or focusing on information that supports her pre-existing belief that these stocks will recover, while potentially ignoring information that contradicts this view (like their continued poor performance).
    *   *Justification:* The act of creating a "detailed spreadsheet" to track stocks she is "watching" implies a pre-existing interest or belief. Her statement that they are "poised for a turnaround" despite poor recent performance indicates she is looking for confirmation of this belief.

*(Other potential cognitive biases: Representativeness for the tech fund - "hot trend"; Anchoring on her "watched" stocks' past high prices or her initial assessment.)*

**B. Identify and describe one emotional bias Ms. Sharma is exhibiting.** (4 minutes)

1.  **Loss Aversion Bias (manifesting as Disposition Effect):**
    *   *Description:* Ms. Sharma is reluctant to sell existing holdings that have declined in value, stating, "I need to wait for them to recover." This is characteristic of loss aversion, where the pain of realizing a loss is greater than the pleasure of an equivalent gain, leading investors to hold onto losers too long in the hope of breaking even.
    *   *Justification:* Her statement "I need to wait for them to recover" directly indicates an unwillingness to realize losses on her current holdings, which is a common outcome of loss aversion.

*(Other potential emotional biases: Overconfidence regarding her "watched" stocks or past picks; Regret Aversion if her conservatism stems from fear of regretting losses from more aggressive investments.)*

**C. Recommend and justify one action Tanaka could take to address *each* of the three biases identified in Parts A and B.** (9 minutes)

1.  **Addressing Availability Bias (for the tech fund):**
    *   *Action:* Tanaka should provide Ms. Sharma with objective, long-term performance data for the tech sector and the specific fund, including periods of underperformance and volatility. He should compare its risk/return profile to her existing portfolio and her stated conservative risk tolerance.
    *   *Justification:* This helps to counter the recency effect by broadening her information set beyond the recent news article. It provides a more balanced perspective, allowing her to make a more informed decision based on data rather than easily available, potentially biased information.

2.  **Addressing Confirmation Bias (for her "watched" stocks):**
    *   *Action:* Tanaka should review Ms. Sharma's spreadsheet with her and help her to objectively analyze the "watched" stocks. He should encourage her to list reasons *not* to invest in these stocks or to seek out independent research that presents a contrary view. He could also help her establish clear, objective criteria for what constitutes a "turnaround."
    *   *Justification:* This directly counters confirmation bias by forcing consideration of disconfirming evidence and alternative perspectives. It encourages a more disciplined and less biased analytical process for these potential investments.

3.  **Addressing Loss Aversion Bias (for reluctance to sell losers):**
    *   *Action:* Tanaka should reframe the decision to sell losing stocks not as realizing a loss, but as an opportunity to redeploy capital into investments with better prospects that are more aligned with her long-term goals. He can show how the proceeds could be used to reduce overall portfolio risk or improve diversification. He could also analyze each holding based on its future prospects, irrespective of its purchase price.
    *   *Justification:* This approach attempts to mitigate the emotional pain of realizing a loss by focusing on the positive outcomes of making a change (e.g., improved future returns, better goal alignment). It shifts the focus from past mistakes to future opportunities, which can help overcome the paralysis induced by loss aversion. Using a goals-based framework can also help, by showing how the current holding may be detrimental to a specific goal.

**D. Formulate a two-part investment objective for Ms. Sharma's IPS.** (5 minutes)

**Return Requirement:**
The primary return objective is to generate a sufficient inflation-adjusted return to support annual withdrawals of $200,000 (currently 4% of the portfolio) throughout Ms. Sharma's retirement, while also aiming for long-term growth to provide a significant legacy for her grandchildren. This implies a need for both income generation/capital preservation for spending and capital appreciation for the legacy goal. The target return should be at least 4% (spending) + inflation + a margin for legacy growth.

**Risk Tolerance:**
Ms. Sharma has a below-average to average willingness to take risk, as evidenced by her "conservative investor" description and concern about market volatility, despite an above-average ability (capacity) to take risk given her $5 million portfolio and 4% withdrawal rate. Her risk tolerance is constrained by emotional biases such as loss aversion. The portfolio should be managed to mitigate large drawdowns that could exacerbate her discomfort, while still aiming for the growth needed for her legacy goal. A goals-based approach might be suitable, with a "lifestyle protection" bucket managed conservatively and a "legacy" bucket that can tolerate more volatility.

## Case Scenario 3: Fixed Income Portfolio Management

**A. Describe how Maxwell should adjust the portfolio's duration and state one specific action.** (4 minutes)

*   **Description of Adjustment:** The current portfolio duration is 4.8 years, while the IPS target duration is 5.0 years. Therefore, Maxwell needs to **increase** the portfolio's duration by approximately 0.2 years to align with the IPS target.

*   **Specific Action:** To increase portfolio duration, Maxwell could **sell shorter-duration bonds and buy longer-duration bonds**, or he could invest new cash flows into longer-duration bonds. Alternatively, he could use interest rate derivatives, such as entering into a receive-fixed interest rate swap or buying long-maturity bond futures.

**B. Recommend and justify a yield curve strategy and describe one specific way to implement it.** (6 minutes)

*   **Recommendation & Justification:** Given GIM's view that the yield curve is likely to steepen (long-term rates rising more than short-term rates, or short-term rates falling more than long-term rates), Maxwell should implement a **bullet strategy or a barbell strategy that is positioned to benefit from a steepening curve relative to a pure duration match.** More specifically, a **barbell strategy** (concentrating holdings in short-term and long-term bonds, with fewer intermediate-term bonds) would generally outperform a bullet strategy (concentrating holdings in intermediate-term bonds) if the curve steepens non-parallelly (i.e., long rates rise more than short rates, or short rates fall more than long rates). Alternatively, an explicit short-duration position at the long end and long-duration position at the short end (a curve steepener trade) could be used if the portfolio is duration-neutral overall. Given the view is "slight steepening", a less aggressive barbell might be appropriate.

    A strategy that benefits from a steepening curve is one that is short duration at the long end of the curve and long duration at the short end, relative to the benchmark, while maintaining the overall portfolio duration target.

*   **Specific Implementation:** Maxwell could implement a **barbell strategy**. This involves overweighting short-maturity bonds and long-maturity bonds, while underweighting intermediate-maturity bonds, relative to the benchmark or a bulleted portfolio of similar overall duration. If he expects long rates to rise more, he would want to be underweight the very long end or use derivatives to short the long end. If he expects short rates to fall more, he would overweight the short end. A classic steepener is to be long short-term bonds and short long-term bonds (or futures).

    *(Alternative for steepening: a duration-neutral yield curve steepener trade, e.g., buy 2-year bond futures and sell 10-year bond futures in appropriate amounts to maintain overall portfolio duration.)*

**C. Evaluate the appropriateness of a strategy to underweight BBB-rated corporate bonds.** (5 minutes)

The strategy to underweight BBB-rated corporate bonds relative to higher-rated A or AA corporate bonds is **appropriate** given GIM's view and the client's IPS.

*   **Alignment with GIM's View:** GIM anticipates a widening in BBB-rated corporate bond spreads due to concerns about slowing economic growth. Underweighting these bonds would position the portfolio to benefit (or suffer less) if this view materializes, as widening spreads lead to underperformance of the affected bonds.
*   **Alignment with IPS:** The client's IPS specifies a high credit quality mandate (average A rating or better). Shifting allocation from BBB-rated bonds (the lowest tier of investment grade) towards higher-rated A or AA bonds would be consistent with, or even enhance, the portfolio's adherence to this high credit quality mandate. It reduces exposure to potentially riskier segments of the investment-grade market.
*   **Risk Management:** This strategy reduces exposure to bonds that are more sensitive to economic downturns and have a higher risk of downgrade ("fallen angels") if economic conditions deteriorate as GIM suspects.

**D. Explain what Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) measures and why it is useful for GIM's portfolio.** (5 minutes)

*   **Explanation of OAS:** Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) is a measure of the yield spread (in basis points) for a bond with an embedded option (e.g., callable or putable bond) over the benchmark (risk-free) spot rate curve, *after adjusting for the value of the embedded option*. It represents the constant spread that, when added to all the spot rates on the benchmark curve, makes the theoretical price of the bond (calculated using a valuation model that accounts for the option) equal to its market price. Essentially, OAS strips out the option component from the bond's total spread, isolating the compensation for credit risk, liquidity risk, and any other non-option related risks.

*   **Usefulness for GIM's Portfolio:**
    1.  **Comparing Bonds with Different Options:** OAS allows Maxwell to compare the relative value of bonds with different embedded options (e.g., a callable bond vs. a non-callable bond, or two callable bonds with different call features) on a consistent basis. A bond with a higher OAS offers more compensation for its credit and liquidity risk, all else being equal, after accounting for the option's value.
    2.  **Assessing Pure Credit/Liquidity Spread:** Since GIM needs to manage credit quality (average A rating), OAS helps in assessing whether the spread on an option-embedded bond is adequate for its credit risk, separate from the influence of the option. This is crucial for making informed decisions about including such bonds in a portfolio with a high credit quality mandate. Without OAS, a callable bond might appear to offer a high Z-spread, but much of that spread could be compensation to the investor for selling the call option to the issuer, rather than for credit risk.
