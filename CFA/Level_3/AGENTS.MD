# AGENTS.MD - CFA Level 3 Section

## Inherits From
This document inherits principles from the root `AGENTS.MD` and the `/CFA/AGENTS.MD` file. Please review those first.

## 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_3/` directory is dedicated to providing study materials specifically for the Level III CFA Program exam. Content should align with the official CFA Institute Level III curriculum, focusing on portfolio management and wealth planning.

The `CFA/Level_3/README.md` provides an overview of this section's content and is best viewed via `CFA/Level_3/readme_viewer.html`, which uses the site's standard README presentation.

## 2. Content Structure
Content within this directory should follow the structure outlined in `/CFA/AGENTS.MD` (e.g., `Topic_Deep_Dives/`, `Cheat_Sheets/`, `Practice_Exams_Essays/`, `Practice_Exams_Item_Sets/`, `Case_Studies_IPS/`).

## 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 3 Content
*   **Portfolio Management & Wealth Planning Focus:** This is the core of Level III. Content should emphasize synthesis of knowledge and application to portfolio construction and client advisory.
*   **Constructed Response (Essay) Questions:** Provide practice essay questions with guideline answers. Emphasize clear, concise, and well-justified responses.
*   **IPS Construction:** Include materials and case studies on developing Investment Policy Statements (IPS) for individual and institutional clients.
*   **Integration and Synthesis:** Level III requires integrating concepts from all previous levels into a cohesive portfolio management framework.
