## Directory-Specific Instructions: CFA Level 3

### Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from `CFA/AGENTS.MD` (parent directory) and the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_3/` directory contains study materials specifically for the CFA Program Level 3 exam. Content must focus on portfolio management, wealth planning, and the synthesis of knowledge from all three levels. A key component is preparation for the constructed response (essay) questions.

The primary README for this level is `CFA/Level_3/README.md`. Navigation to specific materials is also managed by `CFA/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure and Types
Content within this directory is further organized into subdirectories:
*   `Topic_Deep_Dives/`: Detailed explanations of portfolio management strategies, asset allocation frameworks, behavioral finance applications, risk management, etc.
*   `Cheat_Sheets/`: Concise summaries of key formulas, processes (e.g., IPS construction steps), and GIPS standards.
*   `Practice_Exams_Essays/`: Practice essay questions with detailed guideline answers.
*   `Practice_Exams_Item_Sets/`: Practice item sets similar to the Level 3 afternoon session.
*   `Case_Studies_IPS/`: Focus on Investment Policy Statement (IPS) construction for various client types.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 3 Content
*   **Portfolio Context:** All topics should be framed within a portfolio management or wealth planning context.
*   **Essay Question Practice:**
    *   Guideline answers should be structured, clearly addressing each part of the question.
    *   Emphasize the use of "command words" (justify, formulate, determine, etc.).
    *   Show calculations where required.
    *   Provide insights into how points are typically awarded.
*   **GIPS Standards:** Content related to GIPS must be precise and cover all relevant sections.
*   **Behavioral Finance:** Integrate behavioral finance concepts into portfolio management and client interaction discussions.
*   **Ethical Applications:** Focus on ethical dilemmas in a portfolio management and advisory context.
*   **Integration of L1/L2 Knowledge:** Level 3 assumes mastery of prior levels. Content can and should draw upon this.
