# CFA Level 3 Sample Practice Item Set Exam 1: Questions (Item Sets 1-3)

## Item Set 1: Behavioral Finance (Questions 1-6)

The following information pertains to Questions 1–6.

Maria Gonzalez, CFA, is a financial advisor meeting with two clients, Mr. Smith and Mrs. Jones.

**Mr. Smith** is a 60-year-old retired executive. He proudly states, "I've always managed my own investments and done quite well. I picked several tech stocks years ago that soared. I rarely sell anything because good companies always come back. I generally stick to what I know and don't like complicated new strategies." He shows Maria his portfolio, which is 70% concentrated in three technology stocks, with the rest in a money market fund. He admits he hasn't rebalanced in years.

**Mrs. Jones** is a 55-year-old doctor who recently inherited a significant sum. She says, "I'm very worried about losing this money. My friend lost a lot in the last market downturn by investing in aggressive growth stocks. I've heard bonds are safe, so maybe I should just put everything in government bonds? I really don't want to make a mistake and regret it later." She is hesitant to make any investment decisions.

Maria is trying to understand their behavioral biases to help construct suitable investment portfolios.

**Question 1:**
Mr. Smith's statement, "I picked several tech stocks years ago that soared," when combined with his portfolio concentration, *most likely* exhibits:
A) Hindsight bias.
B) Self-attribution bias.
C) Conservatism bias.

**Question 2:**
Mr. Smith's reluctance to sell ("good companies always come back") and failure to rebalance *most likely* indicate:
A) Status quo bias and endowment effect.
B) Availability bias and mental accounting.
C. Framing bias and anchoring.

**Question 3:**
Mrs. Jones' statement, "My friend lost a lot... I really don't want to make a mistake and regret it later," *most likely* indicates:
A) Overconfidence bias.
B) Regret aversion bias.
C) Confirmation bias.

**Question 4:**
Mrs. Jones' preference for "government bonds because they are safe" after hearing about her friend's loss in growth stocks *most likely* demonstrates:
A) Representativeness bias (base-rate neglect).
B) Availability bias (ease of recall).
C) Illusion of control bias.

**Question 5:**
According to the Bailard, Biehl, and Kaiser (BB&K) five-way model, Mr. Smith would *most likely* be classified as an:
A) Adventurer.
B) Guardian.
C) Individualist.

**Question 6:**
To help Mrs. Jones overcome her strong aversion to potential losses and make appropriate investment decisions, Maria should *least likely*:

## Item Set 2: Asset Allocation & IPS (Questions 7-12)

The following information pertains to Questions 7–12.

The Investment Committee for the University Endowment Fund (UEF) is reviewing its strategic asset allocation (SAA). UEF has a perpetual time horizon and a primary objective to maintain the purchasing power of its assets while funding a consistent annual spending rate of 4% of the endowment's five-year rolling average market value. Expected long-term inflation is 2.5%.

The current SAA and long-term capital market expectations (CMEs) provided by their consultant are:

| Asset Class         | Current SAA Weight | Expected Return (Nominal) | Expected Std. Dev. |
| :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------- |
| Global Equity       | 60%                | 8.0%                      | 16%                |
| Global Fixed Income | 30%                | 3.5%                      | 6%                 |
| Real Estate         | 10%                | 6.5%                      | 12%                |
| **Correlations:**   |                    |                           |                    |
| Equity-Fixed Income | 0.20               |                           |                    |
| Equity-Real Estate  | 0.60               |                           |                    |
| Fixed Income-RE     | 0.10               |                           |                    |

The risk-free rate is 2.0%. The committee is considering two alternative SAAs:
*   **SAA Option 1:** Increase Global Equity to 70%, reduce Global Fixed Income to 20%, Real Estate unchanged.
*   **SAA Option 2 (Risk Parity inspired):** Aims to allocate risk more evenly, resulting in a higher allocation to fixed income with leverage, and lower equity. (Details not provided, but assume it has lower expected return and lower standard deviation than current SAA).

**Question 7:**
The UEF's required nominal rate of return to meet its objectives is *closest* to:
A) 4.0%
B) 6.5%
C) 6.6%

**Question 8:**
The expected nominal return of UEF's current SAA is *closest* to:
A) 6.00%
B) 6.50%
C) 7.05%

**Question 9:**
If the Investment Committee adopts SAA Option 1 (70% Equity, 20% Fixed Income, 10% Real Estate), the expected nominal return of this new SAA would be *closest* to:
A) 6.85%
B) 7.15%
C) 7.95%

**Question 10:**
Which of the following statements regarding Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) is *most accurate*?
A) MVO inputs, especially expected returns, are stable and easy to forecast.
B) MVO often produces highly concentrated and unintuitive portfolio allocations.
C) MVO is a single-period model that effectively incorporates multi-period liabilities.

**Question 11:**
If UEF's investment committee decides to implement a tactical asset allocation (TAA) overlay, this would *most likely* involve:
A) Long-term strategic shifts in asset class weights based on changing objectives.
B) Short-term deviations from the SAA to capitalize on market inefficiencies.
C) Fully replicating a broad market index at all times.

**Question 12:**
A key reason endowments like UEF often have a higher allocation to alternative investments (though only Real Estate is shown here) compared to individual investors is their:
A) Higher liquidity needs.
B) Shorter time horizon.
C) Higher risk tolerance and ability to withstand illiquidity.

## Item Set 3: Fixed Income Portfolio Management - LDI (Questions 13-18)

The following information pertains to Questions 13–18.

The Apex Pension Fund, a defined benefit plan, has a single liability of $50 million due in 10 years. The current market yield curve is flat at 3.0% per annum (bond equivalent yield, semi-annual compounding). The fund's actuary has determined the present value of this liability to be $37,204,560 and its Macaulay duration to be 10 years.

The fund manager is considering two strategies to manage this liability:
1.  **Strategy 1 (Duration Matching):** Invest in a portfolio of two bonds (Bond X and Bond Y) to match the liability's present value and Macaulay duration.
    *   Bond X: 5-year zero-coupon bond.
    *   Bond Y: 15-year zero-coupon bond.
2.  **Strategy 2 (Cash Flow Matching):** Invest in a 10-year zero-coupon government bond with a face value of $50 million.

Assume all bonds are default-free.

**Question 13:**
For Strategy 1 (Duration Matching), the weight to be invested in Bond X (5-year zero) to achieve a portfolio Macaulay duration of 10 years is *closest* to:
A) 33.3%
B) 50.0%
C) 66.7%

**Question 14:**
If Strategy 1 is implemented, and immediately after, all interest rates experience a small parallel increase, the value of the asset portfolio will *most likely*:
A) Decrease by more than the present value of the liability.
B) Decrease by less than the present value of the liability, if asset convexity exceeds liability convexity.
C) Remain unchanged due to duration matching.

**Question 15:**
Which of the following is the *most significant* risk if Strategy 1 (Duration Matching with two zero-coupon bonds) is implemented to immunize the single 10-year liability?
A) Reinvestment risk of coupons.
B) Credit default risk of the bonds.
C) Risk from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve (structural risk).

**Question 16:**
Strategy 2 (Cash Flow Matching with a 10-year zero-coupon bond) is *best* described as a form of:
A) Active yield curve positioning.
B) Contingent immunization.
C) Exact immunization (dedication).

**Question 17:**
If the Apex Pension Fund had multiple liabilities due at various future dates instead of a single liability, which immunization condition would be *more critical* to satisfy for effective multi-liability immunization beyond matching PVs and overall portfolio duration?
A) Asset convexity should be significantly lower than liability convexity.
B) The dispersion of asset cash flow timing around liability cash flow timing should be minimized.
C) The portfolio should consist only of callable bonds.

**Question 18:**
A pension fund using an LDI approach is currently overfunded (Assets > PV of Liabilities). If the fund sponsor wants to reduce the risk of the surplus declining, they would *most likely* seek to:
A) Maximize the correlation between asset returns and liability returns.
B) Minimize the duration of the asset portfolio.
C) Maximize the convexity of the liability portfolio.
