# CFA Level III Cheat Sheet: Economics - Capital Market Expectations

## Overview
This cheat sheet covers key concepts for forming Capital Market Expectations (CMEs) within the Economics section of CFA Level III. Developing robust CMEs is crucial for strategic asset allocation.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will summarize approaches to forecasting economic growth, inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates, as well as methods for developing expected returns for various asset classes.)*

## Key Topics & Frameworks

### 1. Framework for Developing CMEs
*   **Specify the set of expectations needed:** Based on the investment horizon and asset classes involved.
*   **Investigate historical performance:** Understand long-term trends and relationships.
*   **Identify valuation models and their requirements:** e.g., Grinold-Kroner for equities.
*   **Collect the best data possible.**
*   **Interpret current investment conditions.**
*   **Formulate specific expectations.**
*   **Monitor performance and refine expectations.**

### 2. Forecasting Economic Growth (GDP)
*   **Trend Growth Rate Analysis:** Using historical data, statistical models (e.g., time-series).
*   **Growth Accounting (Supply-Side):** %ΔGDP = %ΔTotal Factor Productivity + α(%ΔCapital) + (1-α)(%ΔLabor).
*   **Business Cycle Analysis:** Identifying current phase and forecasting transitions. Leading, lagging, coincident indicators.

### 3. Forecasting Inflation
*   **Quantity Theory of Money:** MV = PY.
*   **Phillips Curve:** Relationship between inflation and unemployment.
*   **Inflation Expectations:** Survey data, break-even inflation rates from inflation-indexed bonds.

### 4. Forecasting Interest Rates
*   **Taylor Rule (for policy rates):** Policy Rate = Neutral Rate + 0.5(GDP_forecast - GDP_trend) + 0.5(Inflation_forecast - Inflation_target).
*   **Term Structure Models (recap from L2):** Expectations, liquidity preference, market segmentation.
*   **Credit Spreads:** Relationship with economic cycle.

### 5. Forecasting Exchange Rates
*   **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):** Relative inflation.
*   **Interest Rate Parity (Covered and Uncovered):** Interest rate differentials.
*   **Balance of Payments Approach.**
*   **Mundell-Fleming Model (impact of fiscal/monetary policy under different exchange rate regimes).**

### 6. Developing Expected Returns for Asset Classes
*   **Equities:**
    *   **Grinold-Kroner Model:** E(Re) ≈ D/P + (%ΔE - %ΔS) + %ΔP/E + Expected Inflation. (D/P = dividend yield, %ΔE = earnings growth, %ΔS = share repurchase yield, %ΔP/E = repricing gain).
    *   **Risk Premium Approach:** E(Re) = Risk-Free Rate + Equity Risk Premium.
*   **Fixed Income:**
    *   **Building Block Approach:** E(Rb) = Real Risk-Free Rate + Expected Inflation + Maturity Premium + Liquidity Premium + Credit Spread.
    *   Forecasting yield changes and their impact on bond prices.
*   **Real Estate:**
    *   **Cap Rate Approach:** E(Rre) ≈ Cap Rate + NOI Growth Rate. (Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value).
*   **Alternatives:** Often qualitative adjustments based on specific strategies.

### Challenges in Forecasting
*   Limitations of economic data (lags, revisions).
*   Model uncertainty and parameter instability.
*   Impact of unforeseen events (geopolitical, natural disasters).
*   Behavioral biases in forecasting.
