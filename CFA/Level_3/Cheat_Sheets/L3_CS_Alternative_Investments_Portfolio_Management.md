# CFA Level 3 Cheat Sheet: Alternative Investments Portfolio Management

**Core Principle:** Level 3 focuses on the role of alternative investments (AI) within a diversified portfolio, due diligence, risk management specific to AIs, and performance evaluation challenges.

## I. Role of Alternative Investments in a Portfolio

*   **Potential Benefits:**
    1.  **Diversification:** Low correlation with traditional assets (stocks, bonds) can reduce overall portfolio volatility. Correlation may increase during crises.
    2.  **Return Enhancement:** Potential for higher returns (alpha from manager skill, illiquidity premium, exposure to unique risk factors).
    3.  **Inflation Hedging:** Some AIs (e.g., commodities, real estate, infrastructure, inflation-linked bonds) can provide protection against inflation.
    4.  **Access to Unique Betas/Risk Factors:** E.g., commodity prices, private market growth.
*   **Considerations for Allocation:**
    *   Investor objectives and constraints (risk tolerance, liquidity needs, time horizon, tax situation, expertise).
    *   Capital market expectations for AIs (risk, return, correlation).
    *   Due diligence requirements and costs.
    *   Often requires longer time horizon and tolerance for illiquidity.

## II. Due Diligence for Alternative Investment Managers and Funds

*   Crucial due to opacity, complexity, and manager-specific risk.
*   **Operational Due Diligence (ODD):** Focuses on non-investment aspects. Aims to detect operational risks, fraud.
    *   Fund administration, custody, auditors, IT systems, compliance, business continuity.
    *   Background checks on key personnel.
    *   Segregation of duties.
    *   Valuation policies and procedures (especially for illiquid assets).
*   **Investment Due Diligence:**
    *   **Manager's Investment Philosophy and Process:** Strategy, edge, consistency, capacity.
    *   **Investment Team:** Experience, stability, depth, incentives.
    *   **Risk Management:** Processes, systems, limits, scenario analysis, transparency of risks.
    *   **Performance Track Record:** Analyze returns, risk, attribution (alpha vs. beta). Beware of biases (survivorship, backfill).
    *   **Fund Terms:** Fees (management, incentive, hurdle, HWM, clawback), lock-ups, gates, redemption rights, side pockets. Alignment of interest.
    *   **Legal and Regulatory Review:** Fund structure, domicile, compliance.
*   **Ongoing Monitoring:** Due diligence is not a one-time event.

## III. Issues in Valuing and Measuring Performance of Alternative Investments

*   **Valuation Challenges:**
    *   **Illiquidity:** Lack of active market prices. Rely on models, appraisals, comparable transactions.
    *   **Subjectivity:** Valuation can be subjective, potential for manipulation.
    *   **Stale Pricing:** Infrequent trading leads to stale prices, understating volatility and correlations.
*   **Performance Measurement Issues:**
    *   **Smoothed Returns (Appraisal Data):** Understates volatility, overstates Sharpe ratios, understates correlation with liquid assets. Need to "unsmooth" returns for analysis.
    *   **Reporting Biases:**
        *   **Survivorship Bias:** Failed funds excluded from databases -> overstated average returns.
        *   **Backfill Bias (Inclusion Bias):** Funds included in databases report past performance, often only if good -> overstated returns.
        *   **Self-Selection Bias:** Managers choose whether to report to databases.
    *   **Non-Normal Return Distributions:** Often skewed, fat tails (leptokurtic). Standard deviation may not be adequate risk measure.
    *   **Appropriate Benchmarking:** Difficult to find suitable benchmarks, especially for unique strategies. Custom benchmarks may be needed.
    *   **Impact of Fees:** Gross-of-fees vs. Net-of-fees returns. High fees can significantly reduce net returns to investors.

## IV. Specific Alternative Investment Classes in a Portfolio Context

### A. Hedge Funds
*   **Role:** Can offer diversification (if low beta), absolute returns, access to specific strategies.
*   **Risks:** Manager risk, strategy risk, liquidity risk, transparency risk, counterparty risk (from leverage/derivatives).
*   **Portfolio Allocation:** Consider strategy, expected risk/return, correlation, fees.
*   **Funds of Hedge Funds (FoHFs):** Provide diversification across multiple hedge funds, easier access. But add another layer of fees.

### B. Private Equity
*   **Role:** Potential for high long-term returns, illiquidity premium.
*   **Risks:** Illiquidity, long lock-ups, vintage year risk (performance depends on market conditions when fund invested), manager risk, valuation uncertainty.
*   **J-Curve Effect:** Negative returns in early years (fees, investments not yet mature), positive returns in later years.
*   **Commitment Pacing:** Managing capital calls over time.
*   **Liquidity Management:** Need to plan for capital calls and long holding periods.
*   **Valuation Metrics:** IRR, DPI (Distributions to Paid-in Capital), RVPI (Residual Value to Paid-in Capital), TVPI (Total Value to Paid-in Capital), MOIC (Multiple of Invested Capital).

### C. Real Estate
*   **Role:** Income generation, capital appreciation, inflation hedge, diversification.
*   **Direct Real Estate:**
    *   Pros: Control, tax benefits, leverage. Cons: Illiquid, management intensive, high transaction costs, geographic concentration.
*   **Indirect Real Estate (REITs, RELPs):**
    *   Pros: Liquidity (REITs), diversification, professional management. Cons: REIT returns can be highly correlated with equities in short term.
*   **Risks:** Market risk (property values), interest rate risk (cap rates, financing), liquidity risk, property-specific risks.

### D. Commodities
*   **Role:** Inflation hedge, diversification (historically low correlation with stocks/bonds). Potential source of return.
*   **Investment Methods:** Futures, ETFs/ETNs, swaps, commodity producer stocks.
*   **Risks:** High volatility, event risk (weather, geopolitics), negative roll yield in contango markets.
*   **Not an income-generating asset** (unless via collateral yield or producer dividends).

### E. Infrastructure
*   **Role:** Stable cash flows (often long-term contracts/regulated), inflation protection, diversification.
*   **Direct vs. Indirect (listed funds, private funds).**
*   **Brownfield (existing) vs. Greenfield (new development - higher risk).**
*   Risks: Regulatory risk, political risk, financing risk (for greenfield), operational risk.

## V. Risk Management for Alternative Investments

*   **Liquidity Management:** Crucial due to illiquidity of many AIs. Match investment horizon with fund liquidity terms. Stagger investments.
*   **VaR and Stress Testing:** May be difficult due to non-normal returns and lack of reliable historical data. Need to adapt models.
*   **Factor Exposure Analysis:** Understand underlying risk factor exposures of AI strategies.
*   **Counterparty Risk Management:** For derivatives, swaps used by hedge funds.
*   **Qualitative Risk Controls:** Strong due diligence, ongoing monitoring, clear investment guidelines.
*   **Diversification within Alternatives:** Across strategies, managers, geographies, vintage years (for PE).

## VI. Fee Structures and Alignment of Interest

*   **Management Fee:** % of AUM or committed capital.
*   **Incentive Fee (Performance Fee):** % of profits.
    *   **Hurdle Rate:** Minimum return before incentive fees are paid. (Soft vs. Hard).
    *   **High-Water Mark (HWM):** Ensures incentive fees only on new net profits above previous peak.
    *   **Clawback Provision:** GP may have to return previously paid incentive fees if fund later underperforms.
    *   **Waterfall (for PE):**
        *   *Deal-by-Deal Waterfall:* GP receives carry on each successful deal, even if fund overall is not yet profitable for LPs. Higher risk for LPs.
        *   *Whole-of-Fund (European) Waterfall:* GP receives carry only after LPs have received back all contributed capital plus preferred return (hurdle) on entire fund. More LP-friendly.
*   **Alignment of Interest:**
    *   GP/Manager co-investment in the fund.
    *   Fee structures that reward long-term performance and alpha, not just beta or luck.
    *   Clawbacks, vesting of carried interest.
    *   Transparency and clear reporting.
