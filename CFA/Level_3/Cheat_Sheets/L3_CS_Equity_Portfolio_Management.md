# CFA Level 3 Cheat Sheet: Equity Portfolio Management

**Core Principle:** Level 3 Equity Portfolio Management focuses on the practical construction and management of equity portfolios, including passive vs. active strategies, portfolio construction techniques, and managing different equity styles and international exposures.

## I. Passive vs. Active Equity Investing

*   **Passive Equity Investing (Indexing):**
    *   **Goal:** Replicate the performance of a specific market index (benchmark).
    *   **Rationale:** Belief in market efficiency, lower costs, tax efficiency.
    *   **Methods of Index Replication:**
        1.  **Full Replication:** Hold all securities in the index in exact proportion to their index weights.
            *   Pros: Low tracking error. Cons: High transaction costs, difficult for broad/illiquid indexes.
        2.  **Stratified Sampling (Cell Matching):** Divide index into cells based on characteristics (e.g., sector, size, style). Sample securities from each cell to match cell weights.
            *   Pros: Lower costs than full replication. Cons: Higher tracking error.
        3.  **Optimization:** Use quantitative models to find a portfolio that minimizes tracking error relative to the index, subject to constraints.
            *   Pros: Can handle complex constraints, potentially lower tracking error than stratified sampling for a given number of stocks. Cons: Can be complex, model risk.
    *   **Tracking Error (Active Risk):** Standard deviation of (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return). Key measure for passive managers (aim for low TE).
    *   **Sources of Tracking Error:** Fees, transaction costs, cash drag, sampling, dividend timing.
    *   **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** Common vehicle for passive equity investing.
*   **Active Equity Investing:**
    *   **Goal:** Outperform a benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis (generate positive alpha).
    *   **Rationale:** Belief in market inefficiencies, ability to identify mispriced securities or time market/factors.
    *   **Active Return (Alpha):** `Rp - Rb`.
    *   **Information Ratio (IR):** `(Rp - Rb) / Tracking Error`. Measures skill of active manager. `IR â‰ˆ IC * sqrt(BR)`.
    *   **Active Share:** Percentage of portfolio holdings that differ from benchmark holdings. Higher active share = more active.
    *   **Styles of Active Management:**
        *   **Value Investing:** Focus on undervalued stocks (low P/E, P/B, high dividend yield).
        *   **Growth Investing:** Focus on companies with high growth potential (high earnings growth, sales growth).
        *   **Market Cap Based:** Small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap.
        *   **Contrarian Investing:** Investing against prevailing market sentiment.
        *   **Activist Investing:** Taking significant stakes to influence company management/strategy.

## II. Equity Investment Styles

*   **Value Style:**
    *   Characteristics: Low P/E, low P/B, high dividend yield, low price/cash flow. Often mature companies, potentially out of favor.
    *   Rationale: Belief that market overreacts to negative news, leading to undervaluation. Mean reversion.
    *   Risks: Value traps (stocks that are cheap for good reason and remain cheap), may underperform in growth-led markets.
*   **Growth Style:**
    *   Characteristics: High P/E, high P/B, low/no dividend yield, high expected earnings growth, high sales growth. Often innovative companies in growing industries.
    *   Rationale: Belief that market underappreciates long-term growth potential.
    *   Risks: High valuations may not be sustained if growth disappoints, sensitive to interest rate increases.
*   **Market-Oriented (Blend/Core) Style:**
    *   Portfolio resembles broad market index. May tilt slightly towards value or growth.
*   **Style Drift:** Manager deviates from stated investment style. Can make portfolio construction and manager selection difficult.
*   **Style Indexes:** Benchmarks for value, growth, and market-cap styles (e.g., Russell Value/Growth Indexes, S&P Style Indexes).

## III. Portfolio Construction Approaches

### A. Fundamental Approaches
1.  **Bottom-Up Security Selection:** Focus on individual company analysis (valuation, fundamentals) to find mispriced stocks. Portfolio is aggregation of best ideas. Sector/country weights are residuals.
2.  **Top-Down Approach:** Start with macroeconomic analysis to determine attractive countries/sectors, then select stocks within those.
3.  **Factor-Based Investing (Smart Beta / Strategic Beta):**
    *   Systematically tilt portfolio towards factors historically associated with higher risk-adjusted returns (e.g., value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility, dividend yield).
    *   Can be implemented passively (factor indexes) or actively (dynamic factor timing).
    *   Benefits: Potential for enhanced returns, diversification, transparency, lower cost than traditional active.
    *   Risks: Factors can underperform for extended periods, data mining concerns, crowding.

### B. Quantitative Approaches
*   Use models and data to make investment decisions.
*   **Screening:** Filter universe of stocks based on predefined criteria (e.g., low P/E, high ROE).
*   **Multifactor Models:** Use multiple factors to rank stocks or forecast returns.
*   **Algorithmic Trading:** Automated execution of trades based on pre-set rules. High-frequency trading (HFT) is a subset.

### C. Long/Short Strategies
*   Take long positions in undervalued stocks and short positions in overvalued stocks.
*   Aims to generate alpha from both long and short side, potentially with reduced market exposure.
*   **Market Neutral:** Aim for zero beta (zero net market exposure). Returns primarily from security selection skill.
*   **Equity Hedge Funds:** Often employ long/short strategies.

## IV. Managing Concentrated Equity Positions

*   **Concentrated Position:** Significant portion of portfolio value in a single stock (e.g., employer stock, inherited stock).
*   **Risks:** High unsystematic risk, lack of diversification, potential for large losses.
*   **Objectives in Managing Concentrated Positions:**
    1.  Reduce risk.
    2.  Generate liquidity.
    3.  Optimize tax efficiency.
*   **Strategies:**
    1.  **Outright Sale:** Simplest, but may trigger large capital gains tax.
    2.  **Staged Sales Over Time:** Spread tax liability, but prolongs risk exposure.
    3.  **Hedging Strategies (using derivatives):**
        *   **Short Sale Against the Box (less common now due to tax rules in some jurisdictions):** Lock in price, defer tax.
        *   **Equity Forward Sale Contract:** Lock in future sale price.
        *   **Purchasing Put Options:** Provide downside protection (protective put). Costly.
        *   **Collar Strategy:** Buy put (floor) + Sell call (cap). Often zero-cost collar. Limits upside and downside.
    4.  **Monetization Strategies (borrow against position):**
        *   Margin loan against shares.
        *   Loan against a prepaid variable forward (PVF).
    5.  **Yield Enhancement:** Write covered calls against the position to generate income. Caps upside.
    6.  **Tax-Optimized Strategies:**
        *   Gifting to charity or family members.
        *   Exchange funds (swap shares for diversified portfolio - for qualified investors).
*   Consider client's emotional attachment, tax basis, and overall financial situation.

## V. International Equity Investing

*   **Benefits:** Diversification (imperfect correlation between markets), exposure to higher growth economies/sectors.
*   **Risks:**
    *   **Currency Risk (Exchange Rate Risk):** Fluctuations in exchange rates affect returns.
        *   `Return_domestic = (1 + Return_local) * (1 + Return_currency) - 1`.
        *   Can be hedged using currency forwards, futures, options, swaps.
    *   **Political Risk:** Government instability, expropriation, changes in laws/taxes.
    *   **Economic Risk:** Recessions, inflation in foreign country.
    *   **Liquidity Risk:** Some foreign markets less liquid.
    *   **Transaction Costs:** Often higher in foreign markets.
    *   **Information Asymmetry / Transparency:** Less information, different accounting standards.
*   **Methods of International Investing:**
    *   Direct purchase of foreign stocks.
    *   American Depository Receipts (ADRs), Global Depository Receipts (GDRs).
    *   International mutual funds / ETFs.
    *   Country-specific funds / ETFs.
*   **Strategic Asset Allocation for Global Portfolios:** Consider global market cap weights, but also home bias, currency considerations, and specific country views.

## VI. Equity Mandates and Manager Selection

*   **Types of Mandates:** Passive (index tracking), Active (value, growth, small-cap, etc.), Long/short, Market neutral.
*   **Manager Selection Process (Due Diligence):**
    *   **Quantitative Analysis:** Past performance (alpha, IR, Sharpe, Sortino), risk metrics, style consistency, attribution analysis.
    *   **Qualitative Analysis:**
        *   Investment philosophy and process (clear, consistent, repeatable?).
        *   Investment team (experience, stability, depth).
        *   Firm structure and ownership (alignment of interests, stability).
        *   Risk management approach.
        *   Operations and compliance.
        *   Fees and expenses.
*   **Performance Attribution:** Decomposing active return into components (e.g., asset allocation, security selection, factor exposures).

**Key for L3 Equity PM:**
*   **Practical Application:** How to actually build and manage different types of equity portfolios.
*   **Integration:** Connects with CME, Behavioral Finance, Risk Management, IPS construction.
*   **Active vs. Passive Nuances:** Deep understanding of implementation, costs, and when each is appropriate.
*   **Managing Specific Challenges:** Concentrated positions, international risks.
