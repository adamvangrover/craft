# CFA Level 3 Cheat Sheet: Ethical and Professional Standards (including GIPS)

**Core Principle:** Level 3 Ethics emphasizes the application of the Code and Standards in complex portfolio management and client advisory contexts, with a significant focus on the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). Professionalism, integrity, and client loyalty are paramount.

## I. The CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct (Application Focus)

*The Code and Standards are identical across levels. Level 3 requires applying them to sophisticated scenarios involving portfolio management, wealth planning, institutional clients, and performance evaluation.*

**Key Areas of Emphasis at Level 3:**

*   **Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care:**
    *   Fiduciary duty in managing client assets according to their specific needs and IPS.
    *   Prudent expert rule: Acting with care, skill, and diligence of a knowledgeable investment professional.
    *   Voting proxies in the best interest of clients.
    *   Soft dollar arrangements: Must benefit the client whose brokerage is used. Best execution remains primary.
*   **Standard III(C) Suitability:**
    *   Developing a comprehensive Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is crucial.
    *   Ensuring all investment decisions are suitable within the context of the client's total portfolio and IPS.
    *   Managing portfolios according to a specific mandate, strategy, or style.
    *   Addressing unsolicited trade requests from clients if unsuitable.
*   **Standard III(D) Performance Presentation:**
    *   Ensuring performance reporting is fair, accurate, and complete.
    *   GIPS compliance is best practice. If not GIPS compliant, presentation must still be thorough and not misleading.
*   **Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality:**
    *   Particularly relevant with high-net-worth clients and sensitive information.
*   **Standard IV(A) Loyalty (to Employer):**
    *   Balancing duties to clients, employer, and market integrity.
    *   Considerations when changing firms (e.g., use of firm vs. personal records/models).
*   **Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis:**
    *   Thoroughness in selecting external managers or investment products.
    *   Due diligence in formulating capital market expectations and asset allocation strategies.
*   **Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients:**
    *   Clearly communicating investment philosophy, process, risks, and limitations.
    *   Regular and clear reporting on portfolio performance and changes in strategy.
    *   Explaining complex strategies or products in an understandable manner.
*   **Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts:**
    *   Identifying and disclosing all potential conflicts of interest (e.g., fee structures, use of affiliated brokers, relationships with external managers). Prominent and plain language disclosure.
*   **Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions:**
    *   Especially relevant for portfolio managers making block trades or allocating limited opportunities (e.g., IPOs).
*   **Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct (AMC):**
    *   Voluntary code for firms. Complements Code and Standards for individuals.
    *   Focuses on firm-level ethical conduct, policies, and procedures.
    *   Six general principles:
        1.  Act in a professional and ethical manner.
        2.  Act for the benefit of clients.
        3.  Act with independence and objectivity.
        4.  Act with skill, competence, and diligence.
        5.  Communicate with clients in a timely and accurate manner.
        6.  Uphold the applicable rules governing capital markets.

## II. Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) - In-Depth

*GIPS is heavily tested at Level 3. Focus on understanding the purpose, scope, key provisions, and application.*

**A. Purpose and Scope of GIPS:**
*   To provide a globally accepted, ethical framework for calculating and presenting investment performance.
*   Goal: Ensure fair representation, full disclosure, and comparability of investment performance among investment managers.
*   Applies to investment management **firms**, not individuals. Compliance is firm-wide.
*   Voluntary standard, but widely adopted.

**B. Key Concepts and Requirements:**
1.  **Definition of the Firm:** The distinct business entity held out to clients as an investment firm. Must be clearly defined.
2.  **Input Data:** Must be consistent, accurate, and use fair market values. Accrual accounting for fixed income; trade-date accounting.
3.  **Calculation Methodology:**
    *   **Total Return:** Must be used, including realized/unrealized capital gains/losses, and income.
    *   **Time-Weighted Rates of Return (TWRR):** Required for composites unless certain criteria for money-weighted return (MWRR) are met (e.g., client controls external cash flows). TWRR eliminates effects of external cash flows.
    *   **Valuation Frequency:** Portfolios must be valued at least monthly. For periods on/after Jan 1, 2010, portfolios must be valued at date of all large external cash flows.
    *   **External Cash Flows:** Daily weighting preferred; approximation methods (e.g., Modified Dietz) allowed if daily valuation not practical (but with restrictions).
4.  **Composite Construction:**
    *   **Composite:** An aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy.
    *   **Requirements:**
        *   All actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios must be included in at least one composite.
        *   Non-discretionary portfolios must NOT be included.
        *   Composites must be defined ex-ante (before performance period).
        *   No cherry-picking. Consistent portfolio inclusion criteria.
        *   Terminated portfolios must remain in their composite's historical record up to the last full measurement period they were under management.
        *   New portfolios included on a timely and consistent basis (e.g., after one full month or quarter).
        *   Carve-outs cannot be included unless separately managed with their own cash balance.
5.  **Disclosure Requirements:** Numerous disclosures are mandatory to ensure transparency and understanding of performance. Examples:
    *   Definition of the firm, composite description, benchmark description.
    *   Fees (gross-of-fees and/or net-of-fees returns, fee schedule).
    *   Currency used, use of leverage/derivatives.
    *   Measure of internal dispersion (e.g., standard deviation of returns) of portfolios within a composite.
    *   Statement of GIPS compliance.
    *   Relevant dates (e.g., composite creation date).
6.  **Presentation and Reporting:**
    *   **Required Time Horizon:** Minimum 5 years of GIPS-compliant history, or since firm/composite inception if shorter. Must build up to 10 years.
    *   **Annual Returns:** Required for composite and benchmark for all years.
    *   Other statistics: Number of portfolios, composite assets, total firm assets, internal dispersion.
    *   Specific reporting requirements for different asset classes (Real Estate, Private Equity, etc.).
7.  **Verification:**
    *   Voluntary, third-party review to confirm firm's claim of GIPS compliance on a firm-wide basis.
    *   Verification tests:
        1.  Whether the firm has complied with all composite construction requirements of GIPS on a firm-wide basis.
        2.  Whether the firmâ€™s processes and procedures are established to present performance in accordance with GIPS requirements.
    *   Verification does NOT ensure accuracy of any specific performance presentation or that a manager will outperform.
    *   Performance examination of specific composites is also possible but separate from firm-wide verification.

**C. GIPS Specific Provisions (2020 Edition Highlights):**
*   **Composites vs. Pooled Funds:** Specific reporting requirements for each.
*   **Money-Weighted Returns (MWRR):** Allowed/required for certain types of funds (e.g., private equity, when client controls external cash flows). IRR since inception, net-of-fees.
*   **Carve-Outs:** Stricter rules. Must be managed with own cash balance and reflect allocation of firm's cash.
*   **Advertising Guidelines:** How firms can reference GIPS compliance in advertisements.

**D. Importance for Level 3 Candidates:**
*   Ability to evaluate whether a firm's performance presentation is GIPS compliant.
*   Understanding the ethical importance of fair and transparent performance reporting.
*   Knowing what information to look for when evaluating a manager's track record.
*   Being able to advise firms on achieving GIPS compliance.

## III. Application of Ethics in Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning

*   **Developing the IPS:** Suitability (III(C)), understanding client needs, clear communication (V(B)).
*   **Asset Allocation:** Loyalty, Prudence, Care (III(A)), Suitability (III(C)). Must be consistent with IPS.
*   **Security Selection:** Diligence and Reasonable Basis (V(A)).
*   **Trading and Execution:** Priority of Transactions (VI(B)), Loyalty, Prudence, Care (III(A)) regarding best execution.
*   **Performance Evaluation:** Performance Presentation (III(D)), Fair Dealing (III(B)) in reporting.
*   **Client Communication:** V(B) - regular, clear, honest updates. Disclose conflicts (VI(A)).
*   **Fee Setting:** Must be fair and reasonable. Disclose clearly (VI(A)). Conflicts of interest can arise (e.g., incentive fees encouraging excessive risk).
*   **Behavioral Biases:** Understanding client biases (and own biases) is part of acting with competence and care. Help clients make rational decisions consistent with their long-term goals.
*   **Managing Conflicts of Interest:** Between client interests and firm/manager interests. Disclosure is key, but sometimes not enough; may need to abstain or remove conflict.

**Key Ethical Challenges at Level 3:**
*   Balancing complex client needs with market realities.
*   Managing conflicts in sophisticated financial products or strategies.
*   Ensuring suitability of complex alternative investments or derivatives.
*   Dealing with pressure for performance.
*   Advising on intergenerational wealth transfer and estate planning.

This cheat sheet covers the Level 3 focus on Ethics and GIPS. Mastery involves not just knowing the rules, but applying them thoughtfully to complex, real-world scenarios. Good luck!I will continue with the Level 3 Cheat Sheets. Next is `L3_CS_Economics_Capital_Market_Expectations.md`.
