# CFA Level 3 Cheat Sheet: Risk Management (Portfolio Context)

**Core Principle:** Level 3 Risk Management focuses on the practical application of risk management techniques within a portfolio context, including identifying, measuring, and managing various financial and non-financial risks, and tailoring risk management to specific investor objectives.

## I. The Risk Management Process

A continuous and iterative process:
1.  **Identify Risks:** Determine potential risks relevant to the portfolio and investor objectives (e.g., market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, currency risk).
2.  **Measure and Analyze Risks:** Quantify risk exposures (e.g., standard deviation, beta, duration, VaR, scenario analysis, stress testing). Understand risk interactions.
3.  **Evaluate and Select Risk Management Strategies:**
    *   **Risk Avoidance:** Not undertaking an activity that creates risk.
    *   **Risk Reduction (Mitigation):** Reducing the level or probability of risk (e.g., diversification, hedging).
    *   **Risk Transfer:** Shifting risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, derivatives like options or CDS).
    *   **Risk Acceptance (Retention):** Bearing the risk and its potential consequences. May involve self-insurance or setting aside reserves.
4.  **Implement Risk Management Strategies:** Execute chosen actions.
5.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously review risk exposures and effectiveness of strategies. Adjust as market conditions or objectives change.

*   **Risk Governance:** Top-down framework establishing risk culture, tolerance, policies, and responsibilities within an organization or for an individual investor (via IPS).
*   **Risk Budgeting:** Allocating a portfolio's total acceptable risk among different sources (asset classes, managers, specific risk factors).

## II. Measuring Market Risk

*   **Value at Risk (VaR):** Minimum loss expected over a specified period at a given probability level (e.g., 5% daily VaR of $1M means 5% chance of losing at least $1M on any given day).
    *   **Methods:** Parametric (Variance-Covariance), Historical Simulation, Monte Carlo Simulation.
    *   **Limitations:** Doesn't measure worst-case loss, can be gamed, assumptions critical, not always subadditive.
*   **Conditional VaR (CVaR) / Expected Shortfall (ES):** Expected loss *given that* the loss exceeds the VaR level. Better captures tail risk.
*   **Standard Deviation (Volatility):** Measures dispersion of returns.
*   **Beta (Î²):** Measures systematic risk relative to market.
*   **Duration (Effective Duration):** Measures interest rate sensitivity of fixed income.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Examines portfolio impact of specific hypothetical events (e.g., market crash, interest rate spike, specific industry event).
*   **Stress Testing:** Examines portfolio impact of extreme movements in key risk factors (e.g., 3 standard deviation move).
*   **Tracking Error (Active Risk):** Standard deviation of active returns (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return).
*   **Factor Sensitivities:** Exposure to macroeconomic or fundamental risk factors.

## III. Managing Market Risk

*   **Asset Allocation:** Primary tool for managing overall portfolio risk. Diversification across asset classes with low correlation.
*   **Hedging with Derivatives:**
    *   **Equity Risk:** Short stock index futures, buy index puts, equity swaps.
    *   **Interest Rate Risk:** Short bond futures, interest rate swaps, buy bond puts/receiver swaptions.
    *   **Currency Risk:** Currency forwards, futures, options, swaps.
*   **Modifying Exposures:** Using derivatives to adjust beta, duration, or currency exposure without trading underlying assets.
*   **Risk Factor Hedging:** Hedging exposure to specific risk factors identified through multifactor models.

## IV. Measuring and Managing Credit Risk

*   **Credit Risk Components:**
    *   **Default Risk:** Probability issuer will fail to meet obligations.
    *   **Loss Severity (Loss Given Default - LGD):** `1 - Recovery Rate`.
    *   **Credit Spread Risk:** Risk of losses from widening credit spreads (even without default).
    *   **Downgrade Risk:** Risk of losses if credit rating is lowered.
*   **Measuring Credit Risk:**
    *   **Credit Ratings:** Agency ratings (S&P, Moody's, Fitch).
    *   **Credit Spreads:** Yield difference vs. benchmark Treasury. Higher spread = higher perceived risk.
    *   **Structural Models (e.g., Merton Model):** Option-based, view equity as call option on firm assets.
    *   **Reduced Form Models:** Statistical models of default probability based on historical data and market variables.
    *   **Credit VaR:** VaR specifically for credit losses.
*   **Managing Credit Risk:**
    *   **Diversification:** Across issuers, industries, geographies.
    *   **Credit Quality Limits:** Setting minimum credit rating or maximum exposure to lower-rated debt.
    *   **Credit Analysis:** In-depth due diligence on issuers.
    *   **Credit Derivatives:**
        *   **Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** Buy CDS to hedge default risk on specific bond/issuer. Sell CDS to take on credit risk (earn premium).
        *   **Credit Spread Forwards/Options.**
        *   **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs):** Can be used to transfer credit risk (though complex and were central to GFC).
    *   **Covenants and Collateral:** In loan agreements and bond indentures.

## V. Measuring and Managing Liquidity Risk

*   **Liquidity Risk:** Risk of not being able to sell an asset quickly at a fair market price.
*   **Sources:** Asset characteristics (trading volume, bid-ask spread, market depth), market conditions (flight to quality).
*   **Measuring Liquidity Risk:**
    *   Bid-ask spread.
    *   Trading volume / market depth.
    *   Time to liquidate.
    *   Liquidity-adjusted VaR (LVaR) - incorporates cost of liquidation.
*   **Managing Liquidity Risk:**
    *   Hold sufficient cash and liquid securities to meet potential needs.
    *   Diversify across assets with varying liquidity.
    *   Establish lines of credit.
    *   Limit exposure to illiquid assets based on investor's liquidity needs and time horizon (from IPS).
    *   For funds: Stagger redemptions, gates, side pockets for illiquid assets.

## VI. Risk Management in Specific Contexts

*   **Individuals:** Risk tolerance (ability and willingness), time horizon, liquidity needs from IPS guide overall risk level. Concentrated positions are a key risk. Goals-based risk management.
*   **Defined Benefit Pensions:** Liability-driven investing (LDI). Focus on managing surplus risk (Asset Value - PV(Liabilities)). Duration matching, immunization.
*   **Endowments/Foundations:** Long time horizon allows for higher risk tolerance and allocation to illiquid alternatives. Key risk is not meeting spending needs + preserving corpus in real terms.
*   **Banks:** Highly regulated. Focus on credit risk, interest rate risk (ALM), liquidity risk, operational risk. Capital adequacy (Basel requirements).
*   **Insurance Companies:** ALM is critical. Match asset characteristics to liability characteristics (duration, cash flow timing).

## VII. Performance Evaluation and Risk Management

*   Risk-adjusted performance measures (Sharpe, Treynor, Information Ratio, Jensen's Alpha).
*   Attribution analysis should consider risk factor exposures. Was alpha due to skill or uncompensated risk-taking?
*   Ensure risk taken was consistent with mandate/IPS.

## VIII. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) - Broader Context

*   Holistic, firm-wide approach to identifying, measuring, managing, and monitoring all risks faced by an organization.
*   Integrates risk management into strategic decision-making.
*   Considers interdependencies between risks.
*   Chief Risk Officer (CRO) often oversees ERM.

## IX. Fintech and Risk Management

*   **Big Data and AI/Machine Learning:** Improved risk modeling, fraud detection, real-time monitoring.
*   **Automated Hedging and Trading Systems.**
*   **Regtech:** Technology to improve regulatory compliance and reporting.
*   **Cybersecurity Risk:** A growing operational risk.

**Key for L3 Risk Management:**
*   **Practical Application:** How to apply risk tools and techniques in real-world portfolio management.
*   **Holistic View:** Understanding how different risks interact and impact overall portfolio.
*   **Investor-Specific:** Tailoring risk management to client's unique IPS.
*   **Integration with Other Topics:** Asset allocation, derivatives, performance evaluation.
*   **Beyond Quantitative Measures:** Importance of qualitative judgment, risk governance, and understanding limitations of models.
