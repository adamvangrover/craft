# CFA Level 3 Cheat Sheet: Behavioral Finance

**Core Principle:** Behavioral finance challenges the traditional finance assumption that investors are perfectly rational and markets are perfectly efficient. It incorporates psychology to explain investor behavior and market anomalies.

## I. Traditional vs. Behavioral Finance

*   **Traditional Finance (Standard Finance):**
    *   Assumes investors are **rational** (risk-averse, utility maximizers, process information correctly - Bayesian updating).
    *   Assumes markets are **efficient** (prices reflect all available information).
    *   Models like CAPM, MPT are based on these assumptions.
*   **Behavioral Finance:**
    *   Recognizes that investors can be **irrational** due to cognitive errors and emotional biases.
    *   Suggests markets can be **inefficient** due to these behaviors, leading to anomalies.
    *   Does not necessarily discard traditional finance, but seeks to augment it.

## II. Cognitive Errors vs. Emotional Biases

*   **Cognitive Errors:** Due to faulty reasoning, memory errors, or inability to process information correctly. Can potentially be corrected with better information or training.
    *   **A. Belief Perseverance Biases:** Tendency to cling to prior beliefs.
        1.  **Conservatism Bias:** Underreact to new information, maintain prior views too strongly. Slow to update beliefs.
        2.  **Confirmation Bias:** Seek out and interpret information that confirms existing beliefs, ignore contradictory info.
        3.  **Representativeness Bias:** Classify new information based on past experiences or classifications (stereotyping).
            *   *Base-Rate Neglect:* Ignore base probabilities.
            *   *Sample-Size Neglect:* Assume small samples represent populations.
        4.  **Illusion of Control Bias:** Overestimate ability to control events.
        5.  **Hindsight Bias:** See past events as having been predictable. "I knew it all along."
    *   **B. Information-Processing Biases:** Faulty processing of information.
        1.  **Anchoring and Adjustment Bias:** Rely too heavily on initial piece of information (anchor) and make insufficient adjustments.
        2.  **Mental Accounting Bias:** Treat different sums of money differently based on source or intended use (separate mental "buckets").
        3.  **Framing Bias:** Decisions affected by how information is presented (framed).
        4.  **Availability Bias (Recency Bias):** Overestimate probability of events that are easily recalled, recent, or vivid.
*   **Emotional Biases:** Stem from feelings, impulses, or intuition. Harder to correct. Focus on adapting to them.
    1.  **Loss Aversion Bias:** Feel greater pain from a loss than pleasure from an equal gain. (Prospect Theory).
    2.  **Overconfidence Bias:** Unwarranted faith in one's own abilities and judgment.
        *   *Prediction Overconfidence:* Underestimate uncertainty of predictions.
        *   *Certainty Overconfidence:* Overstate probability of being right.
    3.  **Self-Control Bias:** Fail to act in pursuit of long-term goals due to lack of self-discipline (e.g., insufficient saving for retirement).
    4.  **Status Quo Bias:** Prefer to keep things the same, avoid change.
    5.  **Endowment Bias:** Value an asset more when one owns it than when one does not.
    6.  **Regret Aversion Bias:** Avoid making decisions that might result in regret (errors of commission vs. omission). Can lead to herding.

## III. Behavioral Finance and Investment Decision Making

### A. Investor Types (BB&K Five-Way Model - Bailard, Biehl, and Kaiser)
Classifies investors along two dimensions: Confidence (confident vs. anxious) and Method of Action (careful vs. impetuous).
1.  **Confident & Impetuous (Adventurer):** Risk takers, concentrated portfolios. Prone to overconfidence, self-control bias.
2.  **Anxious & Impetuous (Celebrity):** Fear being left out, rely on others' opinions. Prone to availability, herding.
3.  **Confident & Careful (Individualist):** Rational, independent thinkers. May do own research.
4.  **Anxious & Careful (Guardian):** Risk-averse, wealth preservers. Prone to loss aversion, status quo bias.
5.  **Middle-of-the-Road (Straight Arrow):** Average investor, balanced approach.

### B. Behavioral Portfolio Theory (BPT) - Shefrin & Statman
*   Investors construct portfolios in layers, each associated with a goal and risk level (mental accounting).
*   Contrasts with MPT's integrated view of portfolio risk.
*   Explains under-diversification and holding concentrated positions.

### C. Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH) - Lo
*   Combines elements of efficient markets and behavioral finance.
*   Markets adapt to changing conditions. Efficiency varies over time.
*   Individuals act in self-interest but make mistakes, learn, and adapt.
*   Competition drives adaptation. Profit opportunities arise and disappear.
*   Risk premiums can change over time. Market efficiency is not an all-or-nothing proposition.

## IV. Impact of Biases on Market Behavior and Anomalies

*   **Momentum Effect:** Stocks that have performed well continue to perform well (and vice-versa).
    *   *Behavioral Explanation:* Representativeness (extrapolating past trends), anchoring (slow adjustment to news), herding.
*   **Value vs. Growth Anomaly:** Value stocks (low P/E, P/B) have historically outperformed growth stocks.
    *   *Behavioral Explanation:* Representativeness (overly optimistic about growth stocks - "glamour" stocks), framing (focus on growth narrative). Investors may overpay for growth.
*   **Bubbles and Crashes:**
    *   *Behavioral Explanation:* Overconfidence, confirmation bias, herding, illusion of control during bubbles. Loss aversion, regret aversion during crashes.
*   **Excessive Trading:**
    *   *Behavioral Explanation:* Overconfidence, illusion of control, self-attribution bias (success to skill, failure to bad luck).
*   **Home Bias:** Preferring domestic investments despite benefits of global diversification.
    *   *Behavioral Explanation:* Availability bias (more familiar with domestic), endowment bias, status quo bias.

## V. Behavioral Factors and Client Relationships (Advisor's Role)

*   **Understanding Client Biases:** Crucial for effective financial advice and IPS construction.
*   **Adapting vs. Mitigating Biases:**
    *   **Cognitive Errors:** Can often be mitigated through education, better information, structured decision-making processes.
    *   **Emotional Biases:** Harder to mitigate. Often better to adapt the portfolio or advice to accommodate them, while still trying to achieve long-term goals.
*   **Developing an IPS with Behavioral Considerations:**
    *   Goals-based investing can align with mental accounting.
    *   Risk tolerance assessment should consider both cognitive and emotional aspects.
    *   Educate clients about potential biases and their impact.
*   **Managing Client Expectations:** Behavioral factors can lead to unrealistic expectations.
*   **Behaviorally Modified Asset Allocation:**
    *   If client has high wealth and low standard of living risk (SLR), can accommodate more emotional biases.
    *   If client has low wealth and high SLR, must try harder to mitigate biases that could derail goals.

## VI. Specific Biases and Their Investment Implications

| **Confirmation**     | Focus on info supporting existing holdings, ignore sell signals.       |
| **Representativeness**| Chase hot trends/managers, overvalue "good" companies.               |
| **Illusion of Control**| Excessive trading, under-diversify (belief in stock picking skill). |
| **Hindsight**        | Overestimate past forecasting ability, take too much risk.             |

| **Availability**     | Invest in familiar/recent "hot" stocks, neglect diversification.      |
| **Loss Aversion**    | Hold losers too long (disposition effect), sell winners too soon. Avoid risk. |
| **Overconfidence**   | Excessive trading, under-diversify, underestimate risk.             |

| **Status Quo**       | Maintain existing portfolio even if suboptimal, avoid rebalancing.   |
| **Endowment**        | Hold inherited/familiar stocks despite unsuitability.                |
