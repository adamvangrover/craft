# CFA Level III Deep Dive: Fixed Income Portfolio Strategies

## Overview
This deep dive explores various strategies for managing fixed income portfolios, a key component of the CFA Level III curriculum. It covers both passive and active strategies, liability-driven investing, and managing yield curve risk.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will discuss indexing, immunization, active strategies based on yield curve views, credit analysis, and derivatives in fixed income portfolio management.)*

## Key Fixed Income Portfolio Management Concepts

### 1. Liability-Driven Investing (LDI)
*   **Objective:** Manage assets to meet future liability obligations. Common for pension funds and insurance companies.
*   **Types of Liabilities:**
    *   Type I: Known amount and timing (e.g., single payment).
    *   Type II: Known amount, uncertain timing (e.g., life insurance payout).
    *   Type III: Uncertain amount, known timing (e.g., floating-rate annuity).
    *   Type IV: Uncertain amount and timing (e.g., P&C insurance claims).
*   **Immunization:** Structuring a bond portfolio to protect against interest rate risk.
    *   **Single Liability Immunization (Macaulay Duration Matching):**
        1.  PV(Assets) = PV(Liabilities).
        2.  Macaulay Duration(Assets) = Macaulay Duration(Liabilities).
        3.  Convexity(Assets) > Convexity(Liabilities) (minimizes structural risk).
    *   **Multiple Liability Immunization:** Cash flow matching or duration matching across multiple liabilities.
    *   **Contingent Immunization:** Active management until a safety net return is hit, then switch to immunization.

### 2. Passive Fixed Income Strategies
*   **Indexing (Replication):** Aim to replicate the performance of a bond index.
    *   **Full Replication:** Hold all bonds in the index in exact proportion. Costly and impractical for broad indices.
    *   **Sampling/Stratified Sampling:** Hold a representative sample of bonds that matches the index's key risk factors (duration, convexity, sector exposure, credit quality).
*   **Enhanced Indexing:** Minor deviations from the index to modestly improve returns.

### 3. Active Fixed Income Strategies
*   **Objective:** Outperform a benchmark index.
*   **Based on Interest Rate Expectations (Yield Curve Strategies):**
    *   **Duration Management:** Lengthen duration if rates expected to fall; shorten if rates expected to rise.
    *   **Convexity Management:** Increase convexity if high volatility expected.
    *   **Key Rate Duration:** Managing exposure to changes in specific parts of the yield curve.
    *   **Yield Curve Reshaping Strategies:**
        *   **Bullet Portfolio:** Concentrated in a specific maturity range.
        *   **Barbell Portfolio:** Concentrated at short and long maturities.
        *   **Laddered Portfolio:** Equal amounts in bonds maturing each year.
*   **Based on Credit Analysis:**
    *   **Credit Spread Analysis:** Identifying mispriced bonds based on credit quality.
    *   **Relative Value Analysis:** Comparing bonds with similar characteristics.
    *   **Sector Rotation:** Over/underweighting sectors based on outlook.
*   **Based on Market Analysis:** Identifying mispricings due to liquidity or temporary supply/demand imbalances.

### 4. Using Derivatives in Fixed Income Portfolios
*   **Interest Rate Futures & Forwards (FRAs):** Hedging or speculating on interest rate movements. Modifying portfolio duration.
*   **Interest Rate Swaps:** Converting fixed-rate exposure to floating-rate or vice versa.
*   **Options on Bonds or Interest Rates (Caps, Floors, Collars):** Hedging or creating asymmetric return profiles.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** Managing credit risk exposure.

### 5. International Bond Investing
*   **Considerations:** Currency risk, country risk, differences in market liquidity and structure.
*   **Currency Hedging Strategies.**

### 6. Performance Evaluation
*   Appropriate benchmark selection.
*   Attribution analysis (decomposing returns into sources like duration, curve, sector, security selection).
