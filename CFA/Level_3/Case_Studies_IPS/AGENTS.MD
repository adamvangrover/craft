# Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this directory and its subdirectories.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the overall repository structure, formatting, and writing style.
*   **Clarity:** IPS case scenarios must be clear and provide sufficient detail. Guideline answers should be well-structured and justifications easy to follow.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Use Markdown effectively, especially for structuring case information and guideline answers.
*   **Accuracy:** All content must align with CFA Institute Level 3 curriculum, particularly regarding IPS components and client type considerations.
*   **File Naming:** Use `L3_Case_IPS_ClientType.md` convention.
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Verify functionality.
*   **Updating Navigation:** When adding new IPS case studies:
    *   Update `CFA/Level_3/Case_Studies_IPS/README.md` to list the new file.
    *   Update `CFA/Level_3/Case_Studies_IPS/index.html` (`filesInDir` JavaScript array).
    *   Notify or update `CFA/index.html` (Materials Library section) and `CFA/Level_3/README.md`.
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: CFA Level 3 IPS Case Studies

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `CFA/Level_3/AGENTS.MD`, `CFA/AGENTS.MD`, and root `AGENTS.MD`. Review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This `/CFA/Level_3/Case_Studies_IPS/` directory focuses on case studies for constructing Investment Policy Statements (IPS) as required in the CFA Level 3 exam.

The main guide is `CFA/Level_3/Case_Studies_IPS/README.md`.
Individual cases are `.md` files.
Navigation is supported by `CFA/Level_3/Case_Studies_IPS/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure for IPS Case Studies
Each case study file should include:
*   **Case Title:** Indicating client type (e.g., "IPS for Defined Benefit Pension Plan").
*   **Client Scenario:** Detailed background information on the client (individual or institutional), including financial situation, goals, constraints, and any specific statements or preferences.
*   **Task/Question:** Typically asking to formulate and justify the components of an IPS (Return Objective, Risk Objective, Liquidity, Time Horizon, Taxes, Legal/Regulatory, Unique Circumstances).
*   **Guideline Answer:** A well-structured answer that addresses each IPS component, clearly justifying each point by linking back to specific facts in the case scenario. This should mimic a high-scoring essay response.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 3 IPS Case Study Content
*   **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Provide enough detail in the scenario to allow for a full IPS construction.
*   **Justification is Key:** Guideline answers must heavily emphasize *justification* for each IPS element, linking it directly to case facts.
*   **Client Type Nuances:** Reflect the specific considerations for different client types (e.g., spending rates for endowments, liability-driven investing for DB plans, tax concerns for individuals).
*   **Command Word Adherence:** Structure answers as if responding to typical Level 3 essay command words (e.g., "Formulate and justify...").
