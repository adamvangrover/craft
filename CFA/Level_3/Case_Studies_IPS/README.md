# CFA Level 3: Case Studies in Investment Policy Statement (IPS) Construction

## Purpose of This Section

Welcome to the Investment Policy Statement (IPS) Case Studies section for CFA Level 3. The ability to formulate a comprehensive and client-appropriate IPS is a critical skill tested extensively in the Level 3 exam, especially in the constructed response (essay) portion. This section is dedicated to providing case studies that allow you to practice and master this core competency.

**The objectives of working through these IPS case studies are to:**

*   Understand the unique objectives and constraints of various client types (individuals, defined benefit pensions, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, banks).
*   Practice identifying and articulating all components of an IPS:
    *   **Return Objectives** (required and desired returns, often quantified).
    *   **Risk Objectives** (ability and willingness to take risk, overall risk tolerance).
    *   **Constraints:**
        *   **L**iquidity needs.
        *   **T**ime horizon(s).
        *   **T**ax considerations.
        *   **L**egal and regulatory factors.
        *   **U**nique circumstances.
*   Develop the skill of **justifying** each element of the IPS with specific facts and circumstances presented in the case.
*   Prepare for the structured response format required in the Level 3 essay exam.

## Existing IPS Case Studies

This directory contains the following detailed IPS case studies, which are also linked from the "Study Materials Library" in the main [CFA Interactive Study Hub](../../../index.html):

*   **[Case Study: IPS for Defined Benefit Pension Plan](./L3_Case_IPS_Defined_Benefit_Pension.md)**
*   **[Case Study: IPS for Endowment Fund](./L3_Case_IPS_Endowment_Foundation.md)**

*(Developer Note: Ensure these case studies include not just the scenario but also detailed guideline answers that demonstrate how to structure a high-scoring response.)*

## General Template/Checklist for Approaching IPS Essay Questions

Successfully answering an IPS question requires a systematic approach:

1.  **Identify the Client Type:**
    *   Individual (e.g., young accumulator, pre-retiree, retiree, entrepreneur with concentrated wealth).
    *   Defined Benefit (DB) Pension Plan.
    *   Endowment.
    *   Foundation (private, community, operating).
    *   Insurance Company (Life, Property & Casualty).
    *   Bank.
    *   *Each client type has typical objectives and constraints â€“ know these well!*
2.  **Read the Case Carefully:**
    *   Highlight or underline key facts related to the client's situation, goals, financial status, and any stated preferences or concerns.
    *   Pay attention to numbers (ages, asset values, spending needs, liabilities).
3.  **Address Each IPS Component Systematically:**
    *   **Return Objective:**
        *   Is there a required return (e.g., to cover spending, meet pension liabilities, maintain purchasing power for an endowment)? Quantify it.
        *   Are there desired returns (e.g., wealth growth)?
        *   Consider inflation and fees.
    *   **Risk Objective:**
        *   **Ability to Take Risk:** Assess based on factors like time horizon, asset base relative to needs/liabilities, liquidity, importance of meeting goals.
        *   **Willingness to Take Risk:** Assess based on client statements, past behavior, psychological profile (if given).
        *   **Overall Risk Tolerance:** Synthesize ability and willingness (e.g., "average," "above-average," "below-average"). Justify your conclusion.
    *   **Constraints (LLTTU):**
        *   **Liquidity:** Any upcoming cash needs (regular spending, one-time large expenditures, emergency reserves)?
        *   **Time Horizon:** Single or multi-stage? Short, intermediate, or long-term? (e.g., a retiree has a shorter horizon than a young endowment).
        *   **Taxes:** Is the client taxable? Are there specific tax situations (e.g., unrealized capital gains, tax-deferred accounts)?
        *   **Legal & Regulatory:** Any specific laws or regulations governing the client (e.g., ERISA for pensions, UPMIFA for endowments, specific insurance regulations)?
        *   **Unique Circumstances:** Anything else not covered? (e.g., concentrated stock holdings, desire to invest in socially responsible investments, specific client preferences, existing portfolio issues).
4.  **Justify, Justify, Justify!**
    *   For every statement you make about an objective or constraint, **link it directly back to a specific fact or piece of information from the case study.** This is where many candidates lose points.
    *   Example: "The client has a high ability to take risk *because* their investment horizon is long (30+ years) and their current asset base significantly exceeds their spending needs."
5.  **Be Clear and Concise:** Use bullet points or short paragraphs for each component. Directly answer the command words in the question (e.g., "Formulate," "Determine," "Justify").

## Credit Analyst's Perspective on IPS Construction

While IPS construction is primarily a portfolio management task, understanding it benefits credit analysts:

*   **Understanding Investor Behavior:** Knowing how different investors (who might be bondholders of the companies you analyze) set their objectives and constraints can provide insights into market dynamics and demand for certain types of debt.
*   **Analyzing Financial Institutions:** If you analyze banks or insurance companies, their own IPS (or regulatory equivalent) drives their investment portfolio, which is a key part of their business and risk profile.
*   **Holistic View:** For credit analysts working in wealth management or with high-net-worth individuals who own businesses, understanding personal IPS considerations can be part of a broader client relationship.

## Ideas for Future IPS Case Studies

*   **Individual Investor Archetypes:**
    *   Young professional focused on wealth accumulation.
    *   Couple nearing retirement with specific income needs.
    *   Retiree focused on capital preservation and income distribution.
    *   Business owner with concentrated stock position and estate planning goals.
*   **Other Institutional Clients:**
    *   Life Insurance Company (focus on asset-liability matching).
    *   Property & Casualty Insurance Company (focus on liquidity and shorter duration).
    *   Bank (managing its investment portfolio).
*   **Cases with Behavioral Biases:** Introduce client statements that reveal common behavioral biases and discuss how these might impact the IPS or client discussions.
*   **Cases Involving ESG/SRI Preferences:** How to incorporate Environmental, Social, and Governance or Socially Responsible Investing considerations into an IPS.

We encourage contributions of new IPS case studies. Ideal contributions will include:
*   A clear and concise client scenario.
*   Specific questions asking to formulate parts or all of an IPS.
*   A detailed guideline answer that demonstrates strong justification and structure.

Mastering IPS construction is a significant step towards CFA Level 3 success and becoming a well-rounded financial professional.
