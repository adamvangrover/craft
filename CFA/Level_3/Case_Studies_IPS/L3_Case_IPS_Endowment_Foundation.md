# CFA Level 3 Case Study: IPS Construction - Endowment Fund

**Scenario:**

You are an investment consultant advising the Investment Committee of the Prestige University Endowment Fund. The endowment was established many years ago with gifts from alumni and aims to support the university's operations and initiatives in perpetuity.

**Endowment Information:**
*   **Current Market Value:** $800 million.
*   **Spending Policy:** The university has a spending policy of distributing 4.5% of the endowment's five-year rolling average market value each year to support its budget.
*   **Investment Objective:** The primary objective is to preserve the purchasing power of the endowment's assets while providing a stable and sustainable level of support to the university. A secondary objective is to grow the real value of the endowment over time.
*   **Time Horizon:** Perpetual.
*   **Inflation:** Expected long-term inflation is 2.5% per annum.
*   **Gifts and Donations:** The university receives modest ongoing annual gifts to the endowment, averaging about 0.5% of the endowment's market value per year.
*   **Investment Committee:** Composed of experienced financial professionals, alumni, and university administrators. They understand investment concepts and are generally comfortable with a long-term growth orientation but are also mindful of the need for consistent support to the university budget. They are open to including alternative investments.
*   **Current Asset Allocation (Simplified):**
    *   Global Equities: 50%
    *   Global Fixed Income: 30%
    *   Real Estate (Direct & REITs): 10%
    *   Private Equity: 5%
    *   Cash: 5%
*   **Other:** The endowment is tax-exempt. There are no unusual legal or regulatory restrictions beyond prudent management.

**Case Questions:**

**A. (20 minutes)**
Formulate the **return objective** for the Prestige University Endowment Fund. Justify your objective and quantify it if possible.

**B. (20 minutes)**
Formulate the **risk objective** for the Prestige University Endowment Fund. Discuss the fund's ability and willingness (as represented by the committee) to take risk. State an overall risk tolerance.

**C. (15 minutes)**
Identify and briefly discuss **two specific constraints** (other than risk and return, and focusing on Liquidity and Unique Circumstances) that are relevant to the Prestige University Endowment Fund's IPS.

**D. (20 minutes)**
The Investment Committee is considering increasing its allocation to alternative investments, specifically by adding a 5% allocation to hedge funds and increasing private equity from 5% to 10%. This would reduce global equities to 40% and global fixed income to 25% (Real Estate and Cash unchanged).

**Guideline Answers & Analysis:**

**A. (20 minutes)**
Formulate the **return objective** for the Prestige University Endowment Fund. Justify your objective and quantify it if possible.

**Guideline Answer:**

The primary return objective for the Prestige University Endowment Fund is to generate a total return sufficient to cover its annual spending policy distributions, offset inflation to maintain the purchasing power of the corpus in perpetuity, and cover investment management expenses. A secondary objective is to grow the real value of the endowment over the long term.

**Quantification:**
1.  **Spending Rate:** 4.5% of the five-year rolling average market value.
2.  **Inflation:** Expected long-term inflation is 2.5%.
3.  **Investment Management Expenses:** These are not explicitly stated but are a cost that needs to be covered. Assume for this calculation they are 0.5% annually (a typical estimate if not given).
4.  **Net Inflows from Gifts:** The endowment receives gifts averaging 0.5% of market value per year. This inflow reduces the net return required from investments to achieve its objectives.

**Required Nominal Return Calculation:**
To maintain purchasing power and cover spending and expenses, the endowment must earn:
`Required Nominal Return = Spending Rate + Expected Inflation + Investment Expenses`
Required Nominal Return = 4.5% + 2.5% + 0.5% = 7.5%

However, the endowment also receives annual gifts averaging 0.5%. This effectively reduces the net draw on the portfolio or the return needed from investments.
`Effective Spending Rate to be covered by investment returns = Spending Rate - Gift Rate`
Effective Spending Rate = 4.5% - 0.5% = 4.0%

So, the required nominal return from the investment portfolio to meet net spending, preserve real value, and cover expenses is:
`Required Nominal Return (from investments) = Effective Spending Rate + Expected Inflation + Investment Expenses`
Required Nominal Return = 4.0% + 2.5% + 0.5% = **7.0%**

**Return Objective Statement:**
"The Prestige University Endowment Fund's primary return objective is to achieve an average annual nominal total return of at least **7.0%** over the long term. This return is intended to cover the net annual spending distribution of approximately 4.0% (after accounting for ongoing gifts), preserve the real value of the endowment against expected inflation of 2.5%, and cover estimated annual investment management expenses of 0.5%. A secondary objective is to achieve returns in excess of this target to allow for real growth of the endowment, thereby enhancing future support for the university."

**Justification:** This objective is consistent with the perpetual time horizon, the need to provide ongoing support to the university, and the desire to maintain the endowment's purchasing power for future generations. The calculation explicitly incorporates all key financial requirements.

**B. (20 minutes)**
Formulate the **risk objective** for the Prestige University Endowment Fund. Discuss the fund's ability and willingness (as represented by the committee) to take risk. State an overall risk tolerance.

**Guideline Answer:**

**Ability to Take Risk:**
*   **Time Horizon:** Perpetual. This is a very long time horizon, which significantly **increases** the ability to take risk and withstand short-term market volatility. Losses can be recovered over time.
*   **Asset Base:** Large ($800 million). While spending is significant, the large base allows for substantial risk-taking.
*   **Spending Policy:** Based on a five-year rolling average market value. This smooths the annual distributions and makes the university budget less sensitive to short-term portfolio volatility, thus **increasing** the endowment's ability to tolerate market fluctuations in its asset base.
*   **Net Inflows:** Ongoing gifts (0.5% per year) provide a small but steady inflow, slightly enhancing the ability to take risk.
*   **Overall Ability:** **Above average to High.** The perpetual time horizon and smoothed spending rule are key factors.

**Willingness to Take Risk (Investment Committee):**
*   **Committee Composition:** "Experienced financial professionals, alumni, and university administrators." This suggests a good understanding of investment risk.
*   **Stated Views:** "Generally comfortable with a long-term growth orientation" indicates a **willingness** to take on investment risk for higher expected returns.
*   **Caveat:** "Mindful of the need for consistent support to the university budget." This implies an aversion to extreme volatility or large drawdowns that could jeopardize the stability of distributions, even with the smoothing rule. This suggests willingness is not unlimited.
*   **Openness to Alternatives:** Being "open to including alternative investments" also signals a willingness to consider less liquid, potentially higher-risk/return assets, which aligns with an above-average risk appetite.
*   **Overall Willingness:** **Above average.** The committee understands the need for growth and is open to strategies that entail risk, but this is tempered by the need for stable university support.

**Overall Risk Tolerance:**
Given that both ability and willingness are above average:
*   **Conclusion on Overall Risk Tolerance:** **Above average.** The endowment can tolerate a significant amount of market and liquidity risk in pursuit of its long-term return objectives, primarily due to its perpetual time horizon and the smoothing mechanism of its spending rule. However, this does not imply an appetite for excessive or uncompensated risk.

**Risk Objective Statement:** "The Prestige University Endowment Fund has an above-average overall risk tolerance. The portfolio should be managed to achieve its long-term real return objectives, accepting a level of market volatility consistent with a growth-oriented, long-term strategy. While short-term fluctuations are acceptable, the risk of significant, permanent impairment to the endowment's real capital value or a sustained inability to meet the spending policy should be minimized. The risk management framework should consider both market risk and the specific risks associated with less liquid alternative investments."

**C. (15 minutes)**
Identify and briefly discuss **two specific constraints** (other than risk and return, and focusing on Liquidity and Unique Circumstances) that are relevant to the Prestige University Endowment Fund's IPS.

**Guideline Answer:**

1.  **Liquidity:**
    *   **Discussion:** The primary liquidity need is to fund the annual spending distribution to the university, which is 4.5% of the five-year rolling average market value. For an $800 million endowment, this is approximately $36 million per year (4.5% * $800M), though the rolling average will smooth this. While ongoing gifts (0.5% or $4M) offset part of this, there's still a net annual cash outflow of around 4.0% ($32M). Additionally, capital calls for private equity commitments represent another liquidity need.
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** A portion of the portfolio must be held in liquid assets (e.g., cash, short-term bonds, liquid public equities/fixed income) to meet these annual spending needs and potential capital calls without requiring the forced sale of illiquid assets at potentially unfavorable prices. The allocation to highly illiquid assets like private equity or direct real estate must be managed within the context of these liquidity requirements. The current 5% cash allocation addresses some of this.

2.  **Unique Circumstances:**
    *   **Discussion:** A key unique circumstance for an endowment is its **perpetual time horizon** and the related goal of **intergenerational equity**. This means the endowment must be managed not only to support current university needs but also to maintain its real value to support future generations of students and faculty at a comparable level. Another unique aspect is its **tax-exempt status**, which means investment decisions can be made without the same tax efficiency concerns faced by taxable investors (e.g., distinction between income and capital gains is less critical from a tax perspective). The reliance on a **spending rule** based on a rolling average is also a unique operational feature.
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** The perpetual horizon and intergenerational equity goal support a long-term, growth-oriented strategy with a significant allocation to equities and other growth assets, including potentially illiquid alternatives that offer higher long-term return potential. The tax-exempt status allows for greater flexibility in investment choices and portfolio turnover without triggering tax liabilities, potentially allowing for more active management or opportunistic rebalancing. The spending rule's smoothing effect also supports a higher tolerance for asset volatility.

**D. (20 minutes)**
The Investment Committee is considering increasing its allocation to alternative investments, specifically by adding a 5% allocation to hedge funds and increasing private equity from 5% to 10%. This would reduce global equities to 40% and global fixed income to 25% (Real Estate and Cash unchanged).
    i. Discuss **one potential benefit** of this proposed change to the asset allocation.
    ii. Discuss **one potential challenge or risk** associated with this proposed change.
    iii. Briefly state whether this change would likely be consistent with the endowment's objectives and constraints, and why.

**Guideline Answer:**

    **i. One potential benefit of this proposed change:**
    *   **Enhanced Return Potential and/or Improved Diversification:**
        *   **Private Equity:** Historically, private equity has offered the potential for higher long-term returns (illiquidity premium, operational improvements by GPs) compared to public equities, which could help the endowment achieve its real growth objective.
        *   **Hedge Funds:** Depending on the strategy, hedge funds can offer diversification benefits (low correlation with traditional assets) and potentially generate alpha, contributing to risk-adjusted returns. Some strategies aim for absolute returns, which can be attractive in various market environments.
        This combined increase in alternatives could improve the portfolio's overall long-term risk-adjusted return profile.

    **ii. One potential challenge or risk associated with this proposed change:**
    *   **Reduced Liquidity and Valuation Complexity:**
        *   Both private equity and many hedge fund strategies are significantly less liquid than public equities and fixed income. Private equity involves long lock-up periods and capital calls. Hedge funds may have lock-ups and gates. This increased illiquidity could strain the endowment's ability to meet its annual spending needs or unexpected cash requirements if not managed carefully.
        *   Valuing these less liquid assets is also more complex and subjective, relying on models and appraisals rather than continuous market prices. This can make performance monitoring and NAV calculation more challenging.

    **iii. Briefly state whether this change would likely be consistent with the endowment's objectives and constraints, and why.**
    *   **Likely Consistent, with Caveats:**
        *   **Why Consistent:** The endowment has a perpetual time horizon and an above-average risk tolerance, which means it has the **ability** to take on the illiquidity and complexity associated with higher allocations to private equity and hedge funds. These investments align with the objective of seeking higher long-term real returns and potential diversification benefits. The committee's openness to alternatives also supports this.
        *   **Caveats/Why Caution is Needed:** The increase in illiquidity must be carefully managed to ensure the annual 4.5% spending needs can always be met. This requires robust liquidity planning for the overall portfolio. Furthermore, successful investment in private equity and hedge funds heavily depends on manager selection skill, so thorough due diligence would be critical. The overall portfolio risk profile would need to be reassessed to ensure it still aligns with the "above average" but not "excessive" risk tolerance.
