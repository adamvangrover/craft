# CFA Level 3 Case Study: IPS Construction - Defined Benefit Pension Plan

**Scenario:**

You are an investment consultant advising the Investment Committee of the Apex Manufacturing Inc. Defined Benefit (DB) Pension Plan. The plan provides retirement benefits to Apex employees based on final salary and years of service.

**Plan Information & Actuarial Data:**
*   **Plan Status:** Frozen to new entrants 5 years ago. No new active members are joining the DB plan; all new employees join a defined contribution plan.
*   **Funded Status:**
    *   Plan Assets (Market Value): $500 million
    *   Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO): $600 million
    *   Funded Ratio (Assets/PBO): 83.3% (Underfunded by $100 million)
*   **Participant Demographics:**
    *   Active Members: 40% (average age 50, average service 20 years)
    *   Deferred Vested Members (no longer employed but due benefits): 20% (average age 55)
    *   Retirees & Beneficiaries: 40% (average age 70)
    *   The proportion of retirees is expected to increase significantly over the next 10-15 years.
*   **Plan Sponsor (Apex Manufacturing Inc.):**
    *   A mature, publicly traded company in a cyclical industry (heavy machinery).
    *   Currently profitable with stable cash flows, but sensitive to economic downturns.
    *   Debt-to-equity ratio is moderate. Credit rating is investment grade (BBB).
    *   The company is committed to meeting its pension obligations and plans to make additional contributions over the next 5-7 years to improve the funded status.
*   **Current Asset Allocation:**
    *   Global Equity: 65%
    *   Global Fixed Income (mostly nominal government & corporate bonds): 30%
    *   Real Estate (REITs): 5%
*   **Investment Committee Views:**
    *   Concerned about the underfunded status.
    *   Willing to maintain a reasonable level of risk to achieve higher returns to close the funding gap but are also aware of the increasing proportion of retirees.
    *   The company's CFO (a committee member) is particularly concerned about the volatility of contributions and the impact of pension performance on the company's financial statements.
*   **Relevant Actuarial Assumptions:**
    *   Discount Rate for PBO: 4.5%
    *   Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets (current assumption): 7.0%
    *   Inflation: 2.0%

**Guideline Answers & Analysis:**

**A. (20 minutes)**
Formulate the **return objective** for the Apex Manufacturing DB Pension Plan. Justify your objective and quantify it if possible.

**Guideline Answer:**

The primary return objective for the Apex Manufacturing DB Pension Plan is to generate returns sufficient to meet all current and future benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries. Given its underfunded status, a secondary objective is to generate returns that, along with sponsor contributions, will improve the funded ratio to at least 100% over a reasonable timeframe.

**Quantification:**
1.  **Meet Ongoing Obligations & Achieve Full Funding:** The plan needs to earn a return that covers the growth of the PBO and helps close the $100 million funding gap. The PBO will grow due to the accrual of interest (at the discount rate of 4.5%) and service cost for remaining active members (though the plan is frozen to new entrants, existing actives still accrue benefits based on salary increases and service).
2.  **Required Return to Maintain Funded Status (without closing gap initially):**
    *   The PBO is expected to grow at approximately the discount rate (4.5%) plus any increase due to ongoing service/salary effects for active members. Let's assume service/salary effects add roughly 0.5-1.0% to PBO growth for simplicity in this context (a full actuarial calculation would be needed). So, PBO growth might be around 5.0-5.5%.
    *   To simply maintain the current funded ratio (83.3%), assets ($500M) would need to grow at a similar rate as the PBO ($600M).
    *   Target asset return to keep pace with PBO growth: `(PBO Growth Rate * PBO) / Assets = (approx 5.0% * $600M) / $500M = 6.0%`.
3.  **Return Needed to Close Funding Gap:**
    *   To close a $100M gap over, say, 10 years, requires additional return or contributions. If relying solely on investment returns on the current $500M asset base, this is a significant additional hurdle.
    *   The plan sponsor intends to make additional contributions, which will help.
4.  **Considering Expected Return Assumption:** The current E(R) on assets is 7.0%. The discount rate is 4.5%. The difference (7.0% - 4.5% = 2.5%) is the implicit rate at which the plan expects assets to outgrow a key component of liability growth.
5.  **Overall Return Objective Statement:**
    "The primary return objective is to achieve an average annual nominal rate of return that is sufficient to meet all benefit obligations as they come due. Given the current underfunded status, the plan aims to achieve a return that, in conjunction with planned sponsor contributions, will improve the funded ratio to 100% within approximately 7-10 years. This requires an asset return that exceeds the growth rate of the PBO. A target nominal return of **at least 6.5% to 7.5%** per annum is appropriate, considering the need to cover the PBO's effective growth rate (interest cost + service cost elements) and contribute towards reducing the existing deficit. This target should be reviewed regularly against actuarial valuations and sponsor contribution plans."

**Justification:** This return objective supports meeting liabilities, aims to close the funding gap over a reasonable period (aided by contributions), and is broadly consistent with, but may challenge, the current expected long-term return on assets. It acknowledges the underfunding and the need for returns to outpace liability growth.

**B. (20 minutes)**
Formulate the **risk objective** for the Apex Manufacturing DB Pension Plan. Discuss the plan's ability and willingness (as represented by the committee/sponsor) to take risk. State an overall risk tolerance.

**Guideline Answer:**

**Ability to Take Risk:**
*   **Funded Status:** Currently underfunded (83.3%). This **reduces** the ability to take risk, as poor investment outcomes would worsen the deficit and potentially require larger sponsor contributions.
*   **Plan Features:** Frozen to new entrants. This means the liability duration will lengthen initially as active members age, then shorten as more enter retirement. The plan is maturing.
*   **Participant Demographics:** 40% retirees already, and this proportion is increasing. This implies a growing need for liquidity and predictability of cash flows to pay benefits, which **reduces** the ability to take on high-volatility investments. The time horizon for a significant portion of liabilities is shortening.
*   **Sponsor Financial Health:** Apex Manufacturing is profitable with stable cash flows but is in a cyclical industry. Its credit rating is investment grade (BBB). This provides a **moderate ability** for the sponsor to make additional contributions if needed, but this capacity is not unlimited and could be strained in an economic downturn.
*   **Time Horizon:** While the plan has ongoing liabilities, the increasing proportion of retirees and the frozen status suggest a shortening effective time horizon for a large part of the liability profile compared to an open, young plan. This somewhat **reduces** ability to take very long-term risks.
*   **Overall Ability:** **Below average to average.** The underfunded status and maturing nature of the plan are key constraints.

**Willingness to Take Risk (Committee/Sponsor):**
*   **Committee Views:** "Willing to maintain a reasonable level of risk to achieve higher returns to close the funding gap" suggests some willingness.
*   **Sponsor Concerns (CFO):** "Concerned about the volatility of contributions and the impact of pension performance on the company's financial statements" indicates a desire to limit downside risk and a potential aversion to strategies that could lead to large, unexpected contribution requirements. This points to a **moderate or perhaps slightly below-average willingness**.
*   **Overall Willingness:** **Moderate.** There's a desire to earn returns to close the gap, but this is tempered by concerns about volatility and financial statement impacts.

**Overall Risk Tolerance:**
The overall risk tolerance should be guided by the lower of ability and willingness, or a careful reconciliation.
*   Ability: Below average to average.
*   Willingness: Moderate.
*   **Conclusion on Overall Risk Tolerance:** **Below average to Moderate.** The primary goal is to secure benefits. While some risk is needed to close the funding gap, the maturing nature of the plan and sponsor concerns about volatility suggest a cautious approach. The risk taken should not jeopardize the plan's ability to meet near-term retiree payments or significantly increase the probability of requiring very large, unexpected sponsor contributions.

**Risk Objective Statement:** "The Apex Pension Plan has a below-average to moderate overall risk tolerance. The investment portfolio should be managed to ensure a high probability of meeting all benefit obligations, with a secondary goal of reducing the funding deficit over time. The plan should seek to avoid significant downside risk that could exacerbate the underfunded status or lead to unacceptably volatile sponsor contributions. Risk should be managed in the context of the plan's liabilities (surplus risk)."

**C. (20 minutes)**
Identify and briefly discuss **three specific constraints** (Liquidity, Time Horizon, Legal/Regulatory) that are relevant to the Apex Pension Plan's IPS.

**Guideline Answer:**

1.  **Liquidity:**
    *   **Discussion:** The plan has significant ongoing liquidity needs to pay benefits to the current 40% of participants who are retirees and beneficiaries. This proportion is expected to increase, meaning liquidity demands will also grow over time. The plan must be able to meet these periodic payments without being forced to sell less liquid assets at inopportune times.
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** A portion of the portfolio must be allocated to liquid assets (e.g., cash, short-term fixed income) to meet near-term benefit payments. The overall allocation to illiquid alternative investments (like private equity or direct real estate, though current allocation is only REITs) should be carefully managed and limited by these liquidity needs.

2.  **Time Horizon:**
    *   **Discussion:** The plan is frozen to new entrants and has a significant and growing proportion of retirees. While some active members have long individual time horizons until retirement, the overall plan's liability duration is likely to shorten as more members retire and begin receiving benefits. The "average" time horizon is multi-stage and effectively shortening for a larger portion of benefit payments. However, some liabilities will extend for many decades.
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** The asset allocation should reflect this maturing profile. While long-term growth assets are still needed due to the underfunding and remaining active/deferred members, the allocation may need to gradually become more conservative over time, with a greater focus on matching the duration and cash flow profile of the retiree liabilities. The ability to take on very long-term illiquid investments might be somewhat constrained compared to a young, open plan.

3.  **Legal and Regulatory Factors:**
    *   **Discussion:** Defined benefit pension plans are subject to extensive regulation in most jurisdictions (e.g., ERISA in the US, similar laws elsewhere). These regulations govern funding requirements, fiduciary duties, allowable investments, reporting, and valuation of liabilities (e.g., prescribed discount rates). Apex Manufacturing must also consider accounting standards (e.g., US GAAP) for how the pension plan affects its own financial statements (P&L volatility, balance sheet liability).
    *   **Implication for Asset Allocation:** Investment choices must comply with all applicable pension laws and regulations (e.g., prudent investor rules). The SAA should consider the impact on regulatory funded status and potential implications for required contributions. The desire to manage volatility of contributions and financial statement impact (as noted by the CFO) will also influence asset allocation, potentially favoring strategies that hedge liability risk or reduce asset volatility.

**D. (15 minutes)**
Considering the plan's characteristics and objectives, recommend and justify **one specific change** to the current strategic asset allocation that the Investment Committee should consider.

**Guideline Answer:**

**Recommended Change:** **Increase the allocation to Global Fixed Income and reduce the allocation to Global Equity.**

**Justification:**
1.  **Liability Matching & Risk Reduction:** The plan is underfunded ($100M deficit) and maturing, with an increasing proportion of retirees. The primary objective is to secure benefits. A higher allocation to fixed income, particularly if structured to better match the duration and cash flow characteristics of the plan's liabilities (especially for retirees and near-retirees), would reduce the volatility of the plan's funded status (surplus risk). This directly addresses the CFO's concern about volatility.
2.  **Current High Equity Allocation:** The current 65% allocation to Global Equity is relatively aggressive for an underfunded, maturing DB plan with a below-average to moderate risk tolerance. While equities offer higher expected returns, they also bring significant volatility, which could worsen the deficit in a market downturn.
3.  **Improved Funded Status Hedging:** Fixed income assets generally have a higher correlation with pension liabilities (which are bond-like) than equities do. Increasing fixed income, especially if duration-matched to liabilities, helps hedge the interest rate sensitivity of the PBO. This means that if interest rates fall (increasing the PBO), the value of the fixed income assets would likely rise, offsetting some of the PBO increase and stabilizing the funded ratio.
4.  **Consistency with Risk Tolerance:** A higher fixed income allocation is more consistent with the "below average to Moderate" risk tolerance derived. It prioritizes capital preservation and liability matching for a larger portion of the assets over maximizing potential returns through high equity exposure.
5.  **Sponsor Contributions:** The sponsor plans to make additional contributions. This reduces some pressure on the investment portfolio to achieve very high returns to close the gap, allowing for a more prudent asset allocation focused on securing benefits and reducing surplus volatility.

**Specifics of the Change:** For example, consider reducing Global Equity from 65% to 50-55% and increasing Global Fixed Income from 30% to 40-45%. The nature of the fixed income (e.g., more long-duration, inflation-linked bonds) should also be reviewed to better align with liability characteristics. The Real Estate allocation could remain at 5% for diversification and inflation hedging. This shift would lower the portfolio's expected return slightly but significantly reduce its overall risk and surplus volatility.
