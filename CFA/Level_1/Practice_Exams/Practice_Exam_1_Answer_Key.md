# CFA Level 1 Sample Practice Exam 1: Answer Key & Explanations

---

**Question 1 (Ethical and Professional Standards)**
**Correct Answer: C) Make reasonable efforts to prevent anyone from acting on this information until it is publicly disseminated.**
**Explanation:** Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information prohibits members and candidates from acting or causing others to act on material nonpublic information. The analyst should not trade on it (Option A) or share it with clients (Option B). The most appropriate action is to prevent its use until public, which may involve encouraging public dissemination by the company or reporting to a supervisor/compliance.

**Question 2 (Quantitative Methods)**
**Correct Answer: B) 5.91%**
**Explanation:** Geometric Mean Return (GMR) = `[(1+R1)*(1+R2)*...*(1+Rn)]^(1/n) - 1`
`GMR = [(1 + 0.15) * (1 - 0.08) * (1 + 0.12)]^(1/3) - 1`
`GMR = [1.15 * 0.92 * 1.12]^(1/3) - 1`
`GMR = [1.18608]^(1/3) - 1`
`GMR = 1.05913 - 1 = 0.05913` or `5.91%`

**Question 3 (Economics)**
**Correct Answer: B) A decrease in total revenue from the sale of the good.**
**Explanation:** If demand is price inelastic (`|Ed| < 1`), the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. Therefore, a price decrease will lead to a proportionally smaller increase in quantity demanded, resulting in a decrease in total revenue (Price * Quantity).

**Question 4 (Financial Reporting and Analysis)**
**Correct Answer: A) $9,000**
**Explanation:** Straight-line depreciation = `(Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life`
`Depreciation = ($50,000 - $5,000) / 5 years`
`Depreciation = $45,000 / 5 years = $9,000 per year`

**Question 5 (Corporate Finance)**
**Correct Answer: C) Project C with a Profitability Index (PI) of 1.15.**
**Explanation:**
A) NPV < 0 indicates the project destroys value. Reject.
B) IRR (8%) < Cost of Capital (10%) indicates the project returns less than required. Reject.
C) PI > 1 indicates that the present value of future cash flows is greater than the initial investment (NPV > 0). Accept.

**Question 6 (Equity Investments)**
**Correct Answer: C) Market capitalization-weighted index.**
**Explanation:** This describes a market capitalization-weighted index, where each security's weight is its proportion of the total market capitalization of all securities in the index.

**Question 7 (Fixed Income)**
**Correct Answer: B) 6.32%**
**Explanation:** Current Yield = `Annual Coupon Payment / Current Market Price`
Annual Coupon Payment = `6% * $1,000 = $60`
Current Yield = `$60 / $950 = 0.063157...` or `6.32%`

**Question 8 (Derivatives)**
**Correct Answer: A) $2**
**Explanation:** The call option is in-the-money because the stock price ($55) is above the strike price ($50).
Intrinsic value at expiration = `Stock Price - Strike Price = $55 - $50 = $5`.
Profit = `Intrinsic Value - Premium Paid = $5 - $3 = $2`.

**Question 9 (Alternative Investments)**
**Correct Answer: B) High-water mark.**
**Explanation:** A high-water mark ensures that performance fees are only paid on new profits that exceed the highest previous value of the fund. A hurdle rate is a minimum return threshold. A lock-up period restricts redemptions.

**Question 10 (Portfolio Management)**
**Correct Answer: B) Objectives.**
**Explanation:** The objectives section of an IPS details the investor's risk tolerance and return requirements/targets. Constraints cover limitations like liquidity, time horizon, etc.

**Question 11 (Ethical and Professional Standards)**
**Correct Answer: B) Dissociate from the activity and seek legal counsel if necessary.**
**Explanation:** Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law requires members to dissociate from any illegal or unethical activity. Reporting to the employer or compliance department first is usually recommended. Seeking legal counsel is also appropriate. Reporting to CFA Institute is not the primary required action for an employer's illegal activities.

**Question 12 (Quantitative Methods)**
**Correct Answer: B) 75%**
**Explanation:** Chebyshev's Inequality states that the minimum proportion of observations within `k` standard deviations of the mean is `1 - (1/k^2)`.
For `k=2` standard deviations: `1 - (1/2^2) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 = 75%`.

**Question 13 (Economics)**
**Correct Answer: B) Interdependent, with each firm considering the reactions of others.**
**Explanation:** Oligopoly is characterized by a few dominant firms. Each firm's decisions (on price, output, etc.) affect the others, leading to interdependent strategic behavior.

**Question 14 (Financial Reporting and Analysis)**
**Correct Answer: B) Expensed as incurred.**
**Explanation:** Under IFRS (IAS 38), research costs must be expensed as incurred. Development costs may be capitalized if specific criteria demonstrating future economic benefit are met, but research costs are always expensed.

**Question 15 (Corporate Finance)**
**Correct Answer: B) High fixed operating costs relative to variable costs.**
**Explanation:** Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) measures the sensitivity of operating income to changes in sales. A higher proportion of fixed operating costs means that a change in sales will have a magnified effect on operating income.

**Question 16 (Equity Investments)**
**Correct Answer: B) Semi-strong form efficiency.**
**Explanation:** Semi-strong form efficiency posits that current security prices reflect all publicly available information, including past market data, financial statements, news, etc.

**Question 17 (Fixed Income)**
**Correct Answer: C) A discount to par value.**
**Explanation:** If the yield required by the market (YTM) is higher than the fixed coupon rate offered by the bond, investors will only be willing to pay less than its par value. This is a discount bond.

**Question 18 (Derivatives)**
**Correct Answer: B) The spot price minus the forward price.**
**Explanation:** For a long forward contract, the payoff at expiration is `Spot Price at Expiration (ST) - Forward Price (F0(T))`. If ST > F, the long position profits. If ST < F, the long position has a loss.

**Question 19 (Alternative Investments)**
**Correct Answer: A) Higher liquidity.**
**Explanation:** Most alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds with lock-ups, real estate) are characterized by lower liquidity compared to traditional investments like publicly traded stocks and bonds. Higher fees and limited historical data are common characteristics.

**Question 20 (Portfolio Management)**
**Correct Answer: C) Systematic risk (beta).**
**Explanation:** The Security Market Line (SML) is a graphical representation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), plotting expected return against beta, which measures systematic risk.
