# CFA Level 1 Sample Practice Exam 2: Answer Key & Explanations

---

**Question 1 (Ethical and Professional Standards)**
**Correct Answer: B) Disclose the offer to his employer in writing and obtain permission before accepting.**
**Explanation:** Standard IV(B) Additional Compensation Arrangements requires members to obtain written consent from all parties involved (employer and client, if applicable) before accepting gifts or compensation that could create a conflict of interest with their employer's interest. Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity is also relevant, as such a gift could compromise objectivity. Declining might be prudent, but disclosure and permission is the first step required by the Standards if considering acceptance.

**Question 2 (Quantitative Methods)**
**Correct Answer: B) 6.5%**
**Explanation:** Expected Return E(R) = Î£ [P(Ri) * Ri]
E(R) = (0.20 * -10%) + (0.50 * 5%) + (0.30 * 20%)
E(R) = (-2.0%) + (2.5%) + (6.0%)
E(R) = 6.5%

**Question 3 (Economics)**
**Correct Answer: B) A decrease in the money supply and higher interest rates.**
**Explanation:** When a central bank sells government bonds, it removes money from the banking system (commercial banks pay the central bank for the bonds, reducing their reserves). This decrease in the money supply tends to push interest rates higher.

**Question 4 (Financial Reporting and Analysis)**
**Correct Answer: B) Lower net income and lower inventory on the balance sheet.**
**Explanation:** In a period of rising prices:
*   LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) assumes the most recently purchased (more expensive) items are sold first. This results in a higher Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
*   Higher COGS leads to lower gross profit and thus lower net income (compared to FIFO).
*   Ending inventory on the balance sheet consists of the older, less expensive items, resulting in a lower inventory value (compared to FIFO).

**Question 5 (Corporate Finance)**
**Correct Answer: C) Operating breakeven point.**
**Explanation:** The operating breakeven point is the level of sales (in units or dollars) at which operating income (EBIT) is zero. At this point, revenues cover all fixed and variable operating costs.

**Question 6 (Equity Investments)**
**Correct Answer: B) Market order.**
**Explanation:** A market order is an instruction to execute a trade immediately at the best price currently available in the market. Limit orders specify a price. Stop orders trigger a market order if a certain price is reached.

**Question 7 (Fixed Income)**
**Correct Answer: B) Callable bond.**
**Explanation:** A callable bond gives the issuer the right (but not the obligation) to redeem the bond before its scheduled maturity date, typically at a specified call price.

**Question 8 (Derivatives)**
**Correct Answer: C) The obligation to sell the stock at the strike price if the option is exercised.**
**Explanation:** The seller (writer) of a call option receives a premium and, in return, takes on the obligation to sell the underlying stock at the strike price if the buyer (holder) chooses to exercise the option.

**Question 9 (Alternative Investments)**
**Correct Answer: B) High degree of regulatory oversight.**
**Explanation:** Hedge funds are typically private investment pools and are generally subject to less regulatory oversight than traditional investment vehicles like mutual funds. They do commonly use leverage, derivatives, and performance-based fees.

**Question 10 (Portfolio Management)**
**Correct Answer: B) The client's investment objectives and constraints.**
**Explanation:** An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is a written document that outlines the client's goals (return objectives, risk tolerance) and limitations (liquidity, time horizon, taxes, legal/regulatory, unique circumstances). It does not typically include specific security selections or market forecasts, which are part of the portfolio management process guided by the IPS.

**Question 11 (Ethical and Professional Standards)**
**Correct Answer: C) All clients must be informed of a recommendation before the member acts on it personally.**
**Explanation:** Standard III(B) Fair Dealing requires that members treat all clients fairly when disseminating recommendations or taking investment action. This implies that clients should be given an adequate opportunity to act on a recommendation before the member or their firm acts on it for their own accounts if the recommendation could affect market prices. While simultaneous dissemination is ideal, it's not always practical. Distributing to larger clients first is unfair. The key is that clients come before personal/firm interests. Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions reinforces this.

**Question 12 (Quantitative Methods)**
**Correct Answer: C) Leptokurtic.**
**Explanation:**
*   **Leptokurtic:** More peaked than normal, fatter tails (Kurtosis > 3, Excess Kurtosis > 0).
*   **Mesokurtic:** Normal distribution shape (Kurtosis = 3, Excess Kurtosis = 0).
*   **Platykurtic:** Flatter than normal, thinner tails (Kurtosis < 3, Excess Kurtosis < 0).

**Question 13 (Economics)**
**Correct Answer: B) Monopolistic competition.**
**Explanation:** Monopolistic competition is characterized by:
1.  Many firms.
2.  Differentiated products (allowing some price-setting power).
3.  Low barriers to entry.
Perfect competition has homogenous products. Oligopoly has few firms and high barriers to entry.

**Question 14 (Financial Reporting and Analysis)**
**Correct Answer: B) Other comprehensive income.**
**Explanation:** Under IFRS, if the revaluation model is chosen for PP&E (IAS 16), increases in an asset's carrying amount as a result of revaluation are generally recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated in equity under the heading "revaluation surplus." Decreases are first offset against any existing surplus for that asset in OCI, then to P/L.

**Question 15 (Corporate Finance)**
**Correct Answer: A) Minimum required rate of return on a company's new investments of average risk.**
**Explanation:** The WACC represents the blended cost of all the capital a company uses (debt, preferred equity, common equity), weighted by their proportions. It is the minimum return a company must earn on its existing asset base to satisfy its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital, and thus serves as the appropriate discount rate for new projects of average risk that will be financed in similar proportions.

**Question 16 (Equity Investments)**
**Correct Answer: C) Equal-weighted index.**
**Explanation:** An equal-weighted index assigns the same weight to each constituent security at inception. Rebalancing is required to maintain equal weights as prices change. Price-weighted indexes are weighted by stock price. Market capitalization-weighted indexes are weighted by each company's total market value.

**Question 17 (Fixed Income)**
**Correct Answer: C) A premium.**
**Explanation:**
*   If Bond Price > Par Value => Trading at a premium (Coupon Rate > YTM).
*   If Bond Price < Par Value => Trading at a discount (Coupon Rate < YTM).
*   If Bond Price = Par Value => Trading at par (Coupon Rate = YTM).

**Question 18 (Derivatives)**
**Correct Answer: C) Zero for both positions.**
**Explanation:** A forward contract is an agreement where the forward price is set such that neither party has to pay anything to enter into the contract at initiation. Therefore, the initial value of the contract to both the long and short positions is zero.

**Question 19 (Alternative Investments)**
**Correct Answer: B) Hedge against inflation.**
**Explanation:** Commodities, particularly those like oil, metals, and agricultural products, have historically shown a positive correlation with inflation, meaning their prices tend to rise when general price levels increase. This makes them a potential hedge against inflation. They are not typically consistent sources of income (unless investing in commodity-producing companies) and are often characterized by high volatility.

**Question 20 (Portfolio Management)**
**Correct Answer: B) Capital Allocation Line (CAL).**
**Explanation:** The Capital Allocation Line (CAL) represents the set of possible investment portfolios formed by combining a risk-free asset with an optimal risky portfolio. The slope of the CAL is the Sharpe ratio of the risky portfolio. The Capital Market Line (CML) is a special case of the CAL where the risky portfolio is the market portfolio. The Efficient Frontier represents optimal portfolios consisting only of risky assets.
