# CFA Level 1 Practice Exam 3: Answer Key

## Section 1: Ethical and Professional Standards

**Question 1: B) Material Nonpublic Information**
*Explanation: Sarah acted on material nonpublic information by changing her recommendation and informing her supervisor before the information was public. This violates Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information.*

**Question 2: B) Disclose the gift to his employer and obtain permission before accepting.**
*Explanation: Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity requires members to disclose potential conflicts of interest, including significant gifts. Accepting such a gift without disclosure could compromise objectivity or appear to do so. Declining might be the most prudent but disclosure and permission is the minimum required step if considering acceptance.*

## Section 2: Quantitative Methods

**Question 3: B) 6.99%**
*Explanation: Geometric Mean Return = [(1+0.10) * (1-0.05) * (1+0.15) * (1+0.08)]^(1/4) - 1
= [1.10 * 0.95 * 1.15 * 1.08]^(1/4) - 1
= [1.30005]^(1/4) - 1
= 1.06991 - 1 = 0.06991 or 6.99%*

**Question 4: A) 0.50**
*Explanation: Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation
= (0.12 - 0.03) / 0.18
= 0.09 / 0.18 = 0.50*

## Section 3: Economics

**Question 5: A) A 1% increase in price leads to a 2.5% decrease in quantity demanded.**
*Explanation: Own-price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded for a percentage change in its own price. A value of -2.5 means demand is elastic, and quantity demanded changes by a larger percentage than price.*

**Question 6: C) Increasing income tax rates.**
*Explanation: Contractionary fiscal policy aims to slow down economic activity, often to combat inflation. Increasing income tax rates reduces disposable income and aggregate demand. Decreasing reserve requirements is expansionary monetary policy. Increasing government spending is expansionary fiscal policy.*

## Section 4: Financial Reporting and Analysis

**Question 7: B) LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**
*Explanation: IFRS prohibits the use of the LIFO method for inventory valuation. FIFO and Weighted-Average Cost are permitted under both IFRS and US GAAP.*

**Question 8: B) $20,000**
*Explanation: Straight-line depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
= ($100,000 - $0) / 5 years = $20,000 per year.*

## Section 5: Corporate Finance

**Question 9: C) -$260**
*Explanation:
PV of CF1 = $20,000 / (1.10)^1 = $18,181.82
PV of CF2 = $20,000 / (1.10)^2 = $16,528.93
PV of CF3 = $20,000 / (1.10)^3 = $15,026.30
Sum of PVs = $18,181.82 + $16,528.93 + $15,026.30 = $49,737.05
NPV = Sum of PVs - Initial Outlay
NPV = $49,737.05 - $50,000 = -$262.95, which is closest to -$260.*

**Question 10: B) 8.5%**
*Explanation: WACC = (wd * rd_after_tax) + (wp * rp) + (we * re)
WACC = (0.30 * 0.04) + (0.10 * 0.07) + (0.60 * 0.11)
WACC = 0.012 + 0.007 + 0.066
WACC = 0.085 or 8.5%*

## Section 6: Equity Investments

**Question 11: B) Current stock prices reflect all past market data, including prices and trading volume.**
*Explanation: Weak-form efficiency states that past market data (prices, volume) is already incorporated into current stock prices, so technical analysis based on this data would not lead to abnormal returns.*

**Question 12: C) 14%**
*Explanation: Holding Period Return (HPR) = (Ending Price - Beginning Price + Dividend) / Beginning Price
HPR = ($55 - $50 + $2) / $50
HPR = ($5 + $2) / $50
HPR = $7 / $50 = 0.14 or 14%*

## Section 7: Fixed Income

**Question 13: B) A discount**
*Explanation: When the yield to maturity (6%) is higher than the coupon rate (5%), the bond will trade at a discount to its face value.*

**Question 14: C) Interest rate risk (Market risk)**
*Explanation: If interest rates rise, the market value of existing fixed-rate bonds will fall. This is interest rate risk (also known as market risk for bonds). Reinvestment risk is more relevant for the proceeds from coupons or maturing bonds when rates fall.*

## Section 8: Derivatives

**Question 15: A) $5**
*Explanation:
Payoff of Call Option = max(0, Stock Price - Strike Price) = max(0, $110 - $100) = $10.
Profit = Payoff - Premium = $10 - $5 = $5.*

**Question 16: C) Futures contracts are typically traded on an exchange; forward contracts are typically OTC.**
*Explanation: Futures are standardized and exchange-traded, while forwards are customized and trade over-the-counter (OTC). Forwards are not typically marked to market daily in the same way futures are (though collateral may be adjusted).*

## Section 9: Alternative Investments

**Question 17: B) 2% management fee and 20% incentive fee on profits exceeding a hurdle rate.**
*Explanation: "2 and 20" typically refers to a 2% annual management fee on assets under management (AUM) and a 20% incentive fee on profits. Often, this incentive fee is applied only to profits above a specified hurdle rate or high-water mark, though the basic "2 and 20" refers to the percentages.* Option A is also plausible, but B is more complete as incentive fees often have conditions. For L1, understanding the basic structure is key.

**Question 18: B) Returns may be negative in the early years before becoming positive.**
*Explanation: The J-curve effect describes the common pattern in private equity where fund returns are negative in the initial years due to management fees and underperforming early investments, followed by improving returns as investments mature and are exited.*

## Section 10: Portfolio Management

**Question 19: C) Unique Circumstances**
*Explanation: The "Unique Circumstances" constraint in an IPS covers client-specific preferences, values-based investing (like ESG), or other restrictions not covered by standard liquidity, time horizon, tax, or legal/regulatory constraints.*

**Question 20: C) Higher systematic risk than the market.**
*Explanation: Beta measures a security's systematic risk relative to the overall market. A beta of 1.0 means the security has market-level systematic risk. A beta greater than 1.0 (like 1.2) indicates higher systematic risk than the market, implying it's expected to be more volatile than the market.*
