## 3. Practice Questions and Answers

Consistent practice is key to success. This section will contain sample questions with detailed explanations.

**(Example Question 1 - Ethical and Professional Standards)**

**Question:** An analyst, while on a business trip paid for by a client, hears material non-public information about another company during a private dinner. According to the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct, the analyst should *most likely*:
    A) Trade on the information immediately.
    B) Disclose the information to their supervisor.
    C) Make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of the information.

**Answer:** B) Disclose the information to their supervisor.

**Explanation:** Standard II(A) â€“ Material Nonpublic Information prohibits members from acting or causing others to act on material nonpublic information. If an analyst receives such information, they should not trade on it. Disclosing it to a supervisor or compliance department is an appropriate step to prevent violations. Option A is a direct violation. Option C might be appropriate in some contexts, but the immediate step is internal disclosure and ensuring no trading occurs.

**(Example Question 2 - Quantitative Methods)**

**Question:** An investment portfolio had annual returns of 10%, -5%, and 15% over three years. The geometric mean return is *closest* to:
    A) 6.67%
    B) 6.32%
    C) 7.50%

**Answer:** B) 6.32%

**Explanation:**
To calculate the geometric mean return (GMR):
GMR = [(1 + R1) * (1 + R2) * ... * (1 + Rn)]^(1/n) - 1
GMR = [(1 + 0.10) * (1 - 0.05) * (1 + 0.15)]^(1/3) - 1
GMR = [(1.10) * (0.95) * (1.15)]^(1/3) - 1
GMR = [1.20175]^(1/3) - 1
GMR = 1.06318 - 1
GMR = 0.06318 or 6.32%
