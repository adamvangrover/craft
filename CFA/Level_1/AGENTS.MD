# Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this directory and its subdirectories.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the overall repository structure, formatting, and writing style. Refer to the main `README.md` and other `AGENTS.MD` files for examples.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Ensure all documentation, explanations, and comments are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Follow standard Markdown syntax. Use formatting (headings, lists, bolding, etc.) to improve readability.
*   **Accuracy:** Verify the accuracy of all information, especially financial concepts, formulas, and examples, aligning with CFA Institute Level 1 curriculum.
*   **File Naming:** Use clear and consistent file names (e.g., `snake_case_for_files.md`, `PascalCaseForFolders/`). Follow existing naming conventions within this level.
*   **Links:**
    *   Use relative links for internal navigation within `/CFA/Level_1/` and to other relevant sections (e.g., main `/CFA/` hub, `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`).
    *   Verify that all links are functional.
*   **Updating Navigation:** When adding new content (e.g., a new cheat sheet or practice exam), ensure that:
    *   The `CFA/Level_1/README.md` is updated if the new content is significant.
    *   The main `CFA/index.html` (specifically the "Study Materials Library" section and potentially `AppData` in its JavaScript) is updated to include links to the new material. This is crucial for discoverability.
*   **Code (if applicable, e.g., for quantitative examples in notebooks):**
    *   Comment code adequately.
    *   Ensure code is functional and tested.
*   **Review:** Before submitting changes, review your work for adherence to these guidelines and the specific task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: CFA Level 1

### Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from the `CFA/AGENTS.MD` file and the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_1/` directory contains study materials specifically for the CFA Program Level 1 exam. Content should align with the official CFA Institute Level 1 curriculum learning outcome statements (LOS).

The primary README for this level is `CFA/Level_1/README.md`. Navigation to specific materials is also managed by `CFA/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure and Types
Content within this directory is further organized into subdirectories:
*   `Topic_Deep_Dives/`: Detailed explanations of complex topics or readings.
*   `Cheat_Sheets/`: Concise summaries of formulas, definitions, and key concepts.
*   `Practice_Exams/`: Multiple-choice questions, formatted similarly to the exam.
*   `Case_Studies/`: Application of concepts to scenarios (less common for Level 1 but can be used for integrated topics).
*   `Quizzes/`: Shorter sets of questions for specific topics.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 1 Content
*   **LOS Focus:** Clearly reference the relevant Learning Outcome Statement(s) from the Level 1 curriculum.
*   **Foundational Knowledge:** Level 1 content should focus on building a strong understanding of fundamental concepts, tools, and terminology.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** Explain concepts in a way that is accessible to candidates new to the material.
*   **Practice Questions:** Ensure questions are multiple-choice with three options, reflecting the Level 1 format. Provide clear explanations for correct and incorrect answers.
