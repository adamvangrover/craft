## 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 1 Content
*   **Foundational Focus:** Level I content should emphasize understanding core concepts, formulas, and definitions.
*   **Multiple-Choice Questions:** Practice questions should be in the multiple-choice format used in the Level I exam.
*   **Breadth over Depth (Relatively):** Level I covers a wide range of topics; ensure key areas of each reading are addressed.
