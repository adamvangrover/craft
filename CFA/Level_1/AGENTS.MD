# Agent Instructions: CFA Level 1

## Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from the `CFA/AGENTS.MD` file and the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_1/` directory contains study materials specifically for the CFA Program Level 1 exam. Content should align with the official CFA Institute Level 1 curriculum learning outcome statements (LOS).

The primary README for this level is `CFA/Level_1/README.md`. Navigation to specific materials is also managed by `CFA/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure and Types
Content within this directory is further organized into subdirectories:
*   `Topic_Deep_Dives/`: Detailed explanations of complex topics or readings.
*   `Cheat_Sheets/`: Concise summaries of formulas, definitions, and key concepts.
*   `Practice_Exams/`: Multiple-choice questions, formatted similarly to the exam.
*   `Case_Studies/`: Application of concepts to scenarios (less common for Level 1 but can be used for integrated topics).
*   `Quizzes/`: Shorter sets of questions for specific topics.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 1 Content
*   **LOS Focus:** Clearly reference the relevant Learning Outcome Statement(s) from the Level 1 curriculum.
*   **Foundational Knowledge:** Level 1 content should focus on building a strong understanding of fundamental concepts, tools, and terminology.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** Explain concepts in a way that is accessible to candidates new to the material.
*   **Practice Questions:** Ensure questions are multiple-choice with three options, reflecting the Level 1 format. Provide clear explanations for correct and incorrect answers.
