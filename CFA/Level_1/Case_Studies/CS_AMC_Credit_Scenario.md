# CFA Level 1 Case Study: Alpha Manufacturing Co. - Basic Credit Scenario Analysis

**Case Type:** Foundational Credit Assessment
**Relevant CFA Level 1 Topics:** Financial Statement Analysis (Ratio Analysis), Corporate Issuers (Sources of Capital, Leverage), Quantitative Methods (NPV).

## Scenario: Alpha Manufacturing Co. (AMC)

Alpha Manufacturing Co. (AMC) is a privately-held company specializing in the production of specialized metal components for the automotive industry. They have been operational for 10 years and have a small, but loyal, customer base consisting of three large Tier-1 automotive suppliers. AMC is currently seeking a small working capital loan of $150,000 from a local bank to manage seasonal fluctuations in orders and raw material purchases.

The bank's junior credit analyst, Sarah Chen, has gathered the following selected financial information for AMC for the most recent fiscal year-end (Year 2) and the prior year (Year 1).

| **Total Liabilities & Equity**    | **1,475**| **1,312.5**|

*(Analyst Note: A small discrepancy in Year 1 Total Liabilities & Equity vs Total Assets is noted. Assume Year 1 Retained Earnings was actually 552.5 to balance, or that Total Assets were 1312.5. For Year 2, the balance sheet balances.)* For the purpose of this case, assume Year 1 Total L&E is 1310, and Retained Earnings was 550, and the difference to 552.5 was a minor prior period adjustment not shown. We will work with the provided numbers as much as possible, focusing on Year 2 for ratio calculations where appropriate. Let's assume Year 1 Retained Earnings was 550 for perfect balancing. `Year 1 Recalculated: RE = 550, Total Equity = 750, Total L&E = 1310`.

**Additional Information:**

*   AMC's annual credit sales are approximately 90% of total Revenue.
*   The proposed working capital loan of $150,000 would be a short-term facility, in addition to any existing short-term bank loan.
*   AMC is also considering investing in a new stamping machine that costs $100,000. It is expected to generate after-tax cash inflows of $30,000 per year for 4 years. AMC uses a discount rate of 12% for such investments.

## Guideline Answers & Explanations:

**Question 1 (Financial Analysis - Liquidity):**

*   **Current Ratio (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `Current Assets / Current Liabilities`
    *   Calculation: `$875 / $320 = 2.73x`
*   **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio) (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `(Cash & Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities`
    *   Calculation: `($75 + $350) / $320 = $425 / $320 = 1.33x`

*   **Comment on Liquidity:**
    *   AMC's current ratio of 2.73x suggests it has $2.73 in current assets for every $1 of current liabilities, which is generally considered healthy and indicates a good ability to cover short-term obligations.
    *   The quick ratio of 1.33x is also above 1.0x, indicating that even without relying on its inventory, AMC can cover its current liabilities with its more liquid current assets.
    *   Overall, based on these snapshot ratios, AMC's liquidity position appears adequate. However, trends and industry comparisons would be needed for a full assessment.

**Question 2 (Financial Analysis - Leverage):**

*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `Total Debt / Total Equity`
    *   Total Debt = Short-Term Bank Loan + Long-Term Debt = $50 + $300 = $350
    *   Total Equity = $855
    *   Calculation: `$350 / $855 = 0.41x` (or 41%)

*   **Indication of Financial Risk:**
    *   A Debt-to-Equity ratio of 0.41x indicates that AMC finances approximately 41% of its equity base with debt, or for every dollar of equity, it has $0.41 in debt. This is generally considered a moderate level of leverage.
    *   It suggests that the company has a reasonable cushion provided by equity holders to absorb losses before debtholders are impacted. However, whether this level is appropriate would depend on industry norms, the stability of AMC's cash flows, and the terms of its debt.

**Question 3 (Financial Analysis - Profitability):**

*   **Gross Profit Margin (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `(Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100%`
    *   Calculation: `($750 / $2,500) * 100% = 30.0%`
*   **Net Profit Margin (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `(Net Income / Revenue) * 100%`
    *   Calculation: `($202.5 / $2,500) * 100% = 8.1%`

**Question 4 (Financial Analysis - Activity):**
*(Assumption: Using Year 2 end-of-period balances for AR and Inventory as proxies for average balances for simplicity in this L1 case, and all sales are credit sales. COGS from Year 2 Income Statement.)*

*   **a) Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `(Accounts Receivable / Revenue) * 365`
    *   Calculation: `($350 / $2,500) * 365 = 0.14 * 365 = 51.1 days`
*   **b) Days Inventory Held (DIH) (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `(Inventory / COGS) * 365`
    *   Calculation: `($450 / $1,750) * 365 = 0.2571 * 365 = 93.9 days`
*   **c) Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `(Accounts Payable / COGS) * 365`
    *   Calculation: `($200 / $1,750) * 365 = 0.1143 * 365 = 41.7 days`
*   **d) Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) (Year 2):**
    *   Formula: `DSO + DIH - DPO`
    *   Calculation: `51.1 + 93.9 - 41.7 = 103.3 days`

**Question 5 (Corporate Issuers - Capital Budgeting):**

*   **Net Present Value (NPV) of Stamping Machine:**
    *   Initial Outlay (Year 0): -$100,000
    *   Cash Inflows (Years 1-4): $30,000 per year
    *   Discount Rate: 12% (0.12)
    *   NPV Formula: `Sum of [CFt / (1+r)^t] - Initial Outlay`
        *   PV of CF1: $30,000 / (1.12)^1 = $30,000 / 1.12 = $26,785.71
        *   PV of CF2: $30,000 / (1.12)^2 = $30,000 / 1.2544 = $23,915.82
        *   PV of CF3: $30,000 / (1.12)^3 = $30,000 / 1.404928 = $21,353.41
        *   PV of CF4: $30,000 / (1.12)^4 = $30,000 / 1.573519 = $19,065.54
    *   Sum of PV of Cash Inflows = $26,785.71 + $23,915.82 + $21,353.41 + $19,065.54 = $91,120.48
    *   NPV = $91,120.48 - $100,000 = -$8,879.52

*   **Investment Decision:**
    *   Based solely on the NPV of -$8,879.52, which is negative, AMC should **not** invest in the new stamping machine, as the project is expected to decrease shareholder wealth.

**Question 6 (Corporate Issuers/Credit Principles - Qualitative):**

*   **Potential Concerns for a Credit Analyst:**
    1.  **Customer Concentration:** AMC relies on only three large customers. The loss or financial difficulty of any one of these customers could significantly impact AMC's revenue and ability to service debt. The working capital loan might be to bridge gaps caused by payment terms from these large customers.
    2.  **High Inventory Levels / Long Cash Conversion Cycle:** The DIH of ~94 days and CCC of ~103 days are quite long. This ties up a significant amount of cash in working capital. The loan request might be to fund this already inefficient cycle, rather than just seasonality. This could indicate slow-moving inventory or issues matching production to actual sales.
    3.  *(Alternative Concern)* **Purpose of Loan & Existing Debt:** While liquidity ratios appear adequate, taking on an additional $150,000 in short-term debt for "working capital" when they already have a $50,000 short-term loan and a long CCC needs careful scrutiny. Is this a temporary need or a sign of ongoing cash flow pressure?

*   **Potential Strength or Mitigating Factor:**
    1.  **Consistent Profitability & Equity Growth:** AMC has been profitable in both Year 1 and Year 2, and its retained earnings have increased, leading to a stronger equity base ($750k to $855k assuming corrected Y1). This demonstrates an ability to generate earnings and reinvest in the business, which is positive for creditors.
    2.  *(Alternative Strength)* **Moderate Leverage:** The Debt-to-Equity ratio of 0.41x is moderate, suggesting that the company is not overly burdened by existing debt and has some capacity for additional borrowing, provided the use of funds is sound.
