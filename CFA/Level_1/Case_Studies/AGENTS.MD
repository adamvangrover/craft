## Directory-Specific Instructions: CFA Level 1 Case Studies

### Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from `CFA/Level_1/AGENTS.MD`, `CFA/AGENTS.MD`, and the root `AGENTS.MD`. Please review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_1/Case_Studies/` directory contains case studies designed to help candidates apply CFA Level 1 concepts, particularly with a view towards foundational credit analysis skills.

The introductory guide for this section is `CFA/Level_1/Case_Studies/README.md`.
Individual case studies are `.md` files (e.g., `CS_AMC_Credit_Scenario.md`).
Navigation is also supported by `CFA/Level_1/Case_Studies/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure for Case Studies
Each case study should ideally include:
*   **Case Title:** Clear and descriptive.
*   **Learning Objectives:** List the specific Level 1 concepts or LOS covered.
*   **Company Profile/Scenario Background:** Brief overview of the subject company or situation.
*   **Data/Information:** Relevant financial data snippets, market information, or qualitative details.
*   **Questions/Tasks:** Prompts requiring application of Level 1 knowledge.
*   **Guideline Answers/Analysis:** Detailed explanations for the questions/tasks, showing how Level 1 concepts are applied.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 1 Case Study Content
*   **Relevance to Level 1:** Ensure questions and required knowledge strictly adhere to the Level 1 curriculum. Avoid introducing Level 2 or 3 concepts.
*   **Practical Application:** Focus on how theoretical concepts are used in a practical (even if simplified) context.
*   **Credit Analysis Angle (where appropriate):** While covering broad Level 1 topics, try to frame scenarios or questions that would resonate with someone learning credit analysis (e.g., assessing liquidity, solvency, basic project viability).
*   **Clarity of Questions:** Ensure case questions are unambiguous.

Refer to parent `AGENTS.MD` files for broader CFA and repository guidelines.
