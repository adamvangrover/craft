# CFA Level 1: Case Studies for Foundational Credit Analysis

## Purpose of This Section

Welcome to the Case Studies section for CFA Level 1. While Level 1 of the CFA Program primarily focuses on foundational knowledge and comprehension of investment tools, applying these concepts through case studies can significantly enhance understanding and retention, especially for aspiring credit analysts.

The case studies in this section (or outlines for them) are designed to:

*   Illustrate how core Level 1 concepts (from Financial Statement Analysis, Corporate Finance, Equity, Fixed Income, and Ethics) can be applied to real-world or hypothetical company scenarios.
*   Develop basic analytical and critical thinking skills relevant to credit assessment.
*   Bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application.

**Note for Students:** Level 1 exam questions are typically direct multiple-choice questions. These case studies are for supplementary learning and to build a stronger foundation for Level 2's vignette style and for future credit analysis work.

## What Makes a Good Level 1 Case Study (Credit Focus)?

A relevant Level 1 case study with a credit analysis tilt might involve:

1.  **Company Profile:** A brief description of a hypothetical company, its industry, and its main products/services.
2.  **Financial Data:** Snippets of financial statements (e.g., Balance Sheet, Income Statement excerpts).
3.  **Scenario/Problem:** A specific question or series of questions that require applying Level 1 concepts.
4.  **Learning Objectives:** Clearly stated concepts from the CFA curriculum that the case aims to test or illustrate.

## Example Case Study Outline: "Alpha Manufacturing Co. - Basic Financial Health Check"

This example outlines a potential case study. As this section develops, full case studies will be added.

**3. Scenario Questions (Applying Level 1 Concepts):**

    *   **Financial Analysis (Quantitative Methods, FSA):**
        *   Calculate AMC's current ratio and quick ratio for Year 2. What do these indicate about its liquidity?
        *   Calculate AMC's Debt-to-Equity ratio for Year 2.
        *   Calculate AMC's Gross Profit Margin and Net Profit Margin for Year 2.
        *   If AMC's inventory turnover in Year 2 was 4x, what was its average inventory holding period (days)?
    *   **Corporate Finance (Now "Corporate Issuers"):**
        *   AMC is considering a new project. What is the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project with an initial outlay of $100,000, expected cash inflows of $40,000 per year for 3 years, and a discount rate of 10%? Should AMC undertake this project based on NPV?
        *   What is one advantage and one disadvantage of AMC using debt to finance its new machinery?
    *   **Equity & Fixed Income (Basic Concepts):**
        *   If AMC had publicly traded bonds, and market interest rates increased, what would likely happen to the price of its existing bonds?
        *   Briefly explain the concept of "systematic risk" and how it might apply to AMC.
    *   **Ethical Considerations (Ethical and Professional Standards):**
        *   A junior analyst at a bank is reviewing AMC for a loan. The analyst owns stock in one of AMC's largest customers. What is the most appropriate action the analyst should take according to CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct?

**4. Learning Objectives Illustrated:**

    *   Application of key liquidity, solvency, and profitability ratios (FSA).
    *   Understanding and calculation of inventory turnover and days of inventory on hand (FSA).
    *   Basic capital budgeting techniques (NPV calculation and decision rule) (Corporate Issuers).
    *   Understanding financial leverage (Corporate Issuers).
    *   Inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices (Fixed Income).
    *   Concept of systematic risk (Portfolio Management, Equity).
    *   Identifying and managing conflicts of interest (Ethics - Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts).

## Future Case Studies:

This section will be populated with more detailed case studies covering various Level 1 topics, including (but not limited to):

*   Time Value of Money applications.
*   Statistical analysis of investment returns.
*   Analysis of different accounting methods (e.g., LIFO vs. FIFO).
*   Understanding different market structures (Economics).
*   More complex ethical scenarios.

**Contributions and suggestions for new case studies relevant to Level 1 and beneficial for credit analysis skill development are highly encouraged!**
