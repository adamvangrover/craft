# Ethical and Professional Standards (CFA Level 1 Deep Dive)

Understanding and adhering to Ethical and Professional Standards is paramount for CFA Program candidates and charterholders. This section provides a deep dive into the core principles. For exam purposes, always refer to the official CFA Institute curriculum as the ultimate authority.

## The CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program (PCP)

The PCP is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the CFA designation by enforcing the Code and Standards. Disciplinary actions can range from private reprimands to suspension or revocation of the CFA charter.

## The Code of Ethics

Six core tenets that all members and candidates must adhere to:

1.  **Act with integrity, competence, diligence, respect, and in an ethical manner** with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets.
2.  **Place the integrity of the investment profession and the interests of clients above their own personal interests.**
3.  **Use reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgment** when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities.
4.  **Practice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner** that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession.
5.  **Promote the integrity and viability of the global capital markets** for the ultimate benefit of society.
6.  **Maintain and improve their professional competence and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals.**

## Standards of Professional Conduct

There are seven broad Standards, each with sub-sections detailing specific required or prohibited conduct.

### I. Professionalism

*   **A. Knowledge of the Law:**
    *   Understand and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct) of any government, regulatory organization, licensing agency, or professional association governing their professional activities.
    *   In the event of conflict, comply with the more strict law, rule, or regulation.
    *   Do not knowingly participate or assist in and must dissociate from any violation of such laws, rules, or regulations.
    *   *Example:* If your country's insider trading laws are less strict than the CFA Standards, you must follow the CFA Standards.

*   **B. Independence and Objectivity:**
    *   Use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities.
    *   Do not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another’s independence and objectivity.
    *   *Example:* An analyst writing a research report should not accept lavish gifts from the company being analyzed, as this could compromise their objectivity. Allocations of shares in oversubscribed IPOs to personal accounts can also be a violation.

*   **C. Misrepresentation:**
    *   Do not knowingly make any misrepresentations relating to investment analysis, recommendations, actions, or other professional activities.
    *   Misrepresentation includes guaranteeing investment returns or omitting crucial information.
    *   *Example:* [Plagiarism](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#plagiarism) in research reports or marketing materials is a misrepresentation. Falsely claiming CFA candidacy or charterholder status is also a violation.

*   **D. Misconduct:**
    *   Do not engage in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit or commit any act that reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence. This is covered under [Misconduct](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#misconduct).
    *   *Example:* Personal bankruptcy may not be a violation unless it involves fraudulent or deceitful conduct. Driving under the influence (DUI) that results in a conviction could be a violation if it reflects poorly on professional integrity or competence.

### II. Integrity of Capital Markets

*   **A. Material Nonpublic Information:**
    *   Members and Candidates who possess [material nonpublic information](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#material-nonpublic-information) that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.
    *   Information is "material" if its disclosure would likely impact a security's price or if reasonable investors would want to know it before investing. Information is "nonpublic" until it has been disseminated to the marketplace.
    *   The "[mosaic theory](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#mosaic-theory)" allows analysts to combine public information and nonmaterial nonpublic information to reach conclusions.
    *   *Example:* Learning about a pending merger or a significant earnings surprise before public announcement and trading on that information is a violation.

*   **B. Market Manipulation:**
    *   Do not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants. This is known as [Market Manipulation](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#market-manipulation).
    *   This includes information-based manipulation (spreading false rumors) and transaction-based manipulation (e.g., "pump and dump" schemes, marking the close).
    *   *Example:* Spreading false positive news about a stock to drive its price up and then selling shares is market manipulation.

### III. Duties to Clients

*   **A. Loyalty, Prudence, and Care:**
    *   Have a duty of loyalty to their clients and must act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judgment.
    *   Act for the benefit of their clients and place their clients’ interests before their employer’s or their own interests.
    *   Identify the actual investment client (e.g., beneficiaries of a pension plan, not the hiring manager).
    *   *Example:* An investment manager must ensure that client brokerage commissions are appropriate for the services received (best price and best execution).

*   **B. Fair Dealing:**
    *   Deal fairly and objectively with all clients when providing investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment action, or engaging in other professional activities. This is the principle of [Fair Dealing](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#fair-dealing).
    *   Disseminate investment recommendations and changes in prior recommendations fairly to all clients.
    *   *Example:* If a new recommendation is made, it should be communicated to all clients for whom it is suitable before any personal trading or trading for favored clients occurs.

*   **C. Suitability:**
    *   When in an advisory relationship with a client, members and candidates have a duty of [Suitability](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#suitability):
        1.  Make a reasonable inquiry into a client’s or prospective client’s investment experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints prior to making any investment recommendation or taking investment action.
        2.  Determine that an investment is suitable to the client’s financial situation and consistent with the client’s written objectives, mandates, and constraints before making an investment recommendation or taking investment action.
        3.  Judge the suitability of investments in the context of the client’s total portfolio.
    *   When responsible for managing a portfolio to a specific mandate, strategy, or style, make only investment recommendations or take only investment actions that are consistent with the stated objectives and constraints of the portfolio.
    *   *Example:* Recommending high-risk derivatives to a risk-averse client with limited income would be a suitability violation.

*   **D. Performance Presentation:**
    *   When communicating investment performance information, make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is fair, accurate, and complete. This relates to [Performance Presentation](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#performance-presentation) standards.
    *   Do not misstate performance or mislead clients or prospective clients about investment performance.
    *   Brief, limited performance presentations are acceptable if more detailed information is offered.
    *   *Example:* Cherry-picking the best-performing accounts to show prospective clients without disclosing this selection bias is a violation.

*   **E. Preservation of Confidentiality:**
    *   Keep information about current, former, and prospective clients confidential unless:
        1.  The information concerns illegal activities on the part of the client.
        2.  Disclosure is required by law.
        3.  The client or prospective client permits disclosure of the information.
    *   This is the standard of [Preservation of Confidentiality](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#preservation-of-confidentiality).
    *   *Example:* Sharing a client's portfolio holdings with someone outside the firm without the client's permission is a violation, unless required by law or to report illegal activities.

### IV. Duties to Employers

*   **A. Loyalty:**
    *   In matters related to their employment, act for the benefit of their employer and not deprive their employer of the advantage of their skills and abilities, divulge confidential information, or otherwise cause harm to their employer.
    *   Independent practice for compensation is not permitted without employer consent.
    *   Activities while preparing to leave an employer (e.g., contacting clients, taking employer records) can be a violation.
    *   Whistleblowing to protect clients or market integrity is not a violation.
    *   *Example:* Setting up a competing business while still employed and soliciting employer's clients without permission is a loyalty violation.

*   **B. Additional Compensation Arrangements:**
    *   Do not accept gifts, benefits, compensation, or consideration that competes with or might reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest with their employer’s interest unless they obtain written consent from all parties involved (employer and client, if applicable).
    *   *Example:* An analyst receiving payment from an outside source for writing a research report on a company must disclose this arrangement to their employer in writing and obtain consent.

*   **C. Responsibilities of Supervisors:**
    *   Make reasonable efforts to ensure that anyone subject to their supervision or authority complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the Code and Standards.
    *   This includes establishing and implementing adequate compliance procedures.
    *   *Example:* A supervisor who is aware of inadequate compliance procedures and does not take steps to improve them may be in violation if an employee under their supervision violates the Standards.

### V. Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Actions

*   **A. Diligence and Reasonable Basis:**
    *   Exercise diligence, independence, and thoroughness in analyzing investments, making investment recommendations, and taking investment actions.
    *   Have a reasonable and adequate basis, supported by appropriate research and investigation, for any investment analysis, recommendation, or action.
    *   *Example:* Recommending a stock based solely on a rumor without conducting independent research would be a violation. The level of diligence depends on the product/service offered.

*   **B. Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients:**
    *   Disclose to clients and prospective clients the basic format and general principles of the investment processes they use to analyze investments, select securities, and construct portfolios and must promptly disclose any changes that might materially affect those processes.
    *   Disclose to clients and prospective clients significant limitations and risks associated with the investment process.
    *   Use reasonable judgment in identifying which factors are important to their investment analyses, recommendations, or actions and include those factors in communications with clients and prospective clients.
    *   Distinguish between fact and opinion in the presentation of investment analysis and recommendations.
    *   *Example:* Failing to inform clients that an investment strategy relies heavily on a complex, unproven quantitative model is a violation.

*   **C. Record Retention:**
    *   Develop and maintain appropriate records to support their investment analyses, recommendations, actions, and other investment-related communications with clients and prospective clients.
    *   Records are property of the firm. If no regulatory guidance, CFA Institute recommends a 7-year retention period.
    *   *Example:* Failing to keep notes and supporting documents for a research report makes it difficult to substantiate the analysis if questioned later.

### VI. Conflicts of Interest

*   **A. Disclosure of Conflicts:**
    *   Make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or interfere with respective duties to their clients, prospective clients, and employer.
    *   Ensure that such disclosures are prominent, are delivered in plain language, and communicate the relevant information effectively.
    *   *Example:* An analyst whose spouse holds a significant amount of stock in a company they are recommending must disclose this conflict. Disclosure of referral fees is also required.

*   **B. Priority of Transactions:**
    *   Investment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over investment transactions in which a Member or Candidate is the beneficial owner.
    *   Do not act on personal account transactions until clients and employers have had an adequate opportunity to act on a recommendation.
    *   Personal trading that disadvantages clients is prohibited.
    *   *Example:* Buying shares for a personal account just before issuing a "buy" recommendation for clients is a violation.

*   **C. Referral Fees:**
    *   Disclose to their employer, clients, and prospective clients, as appropriate, any compensation, consideration, or benefit received from or paid to others for the recommendation of products or services.
    *   Disclosure should be made before entering into any formal agreement for services and should detail the nature of the compensation. This concerns [Referral Fees](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#referral-fees).
    *   *Example:* An investment manager who receives a fee from a brokerage firm for directing client trades to that firm must disclose this arrangement to clients.

### VII. Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate

*   **A. Conduct as Participants in CFA Institute Programs:**
    *   Do not engage in any conduct that compromises the reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation or the integrity, validity, or security of CFA Institute programs.
    *   This includes cheating on the exam, revealing confidential exam information, or misrepresenting information on the Professional Conduct Statement.
    *   *Example:* Sharing exam questions with others after taking the exam is a violation.

*   **B. Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program:**
    *   When referring to CFA Institute, CFA Institute membership, the CFA designation, or candidacy in the CFA Program, do not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning or implications of membership in CFA Institute, holding the CFA designation, or candidacy in the CFA Program.
    *   The CFA designation must not be referred to as "CFA Charter" or as a noun (e.g., "He is a CFA."). Acceptable: "John Doe, CFA" or "John Doe is a CFA charterholder."
    *   Candidates may state they are a "candidate in the CFA Program" but not imply partial designation.
    *   *Example:* Stating "I am a Level II CFA" is a violation. Correct: "I am a Level II candidate in the CFA Program."

## Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)

While a detailed knowledge of GIPS is more heavily tested at later CFA levels, Level 1 candidates should be aware of its purpose:
*   [Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)](../../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#global-investment-performance-standards-gips) are ethical standards for investment performance presentation to ensure fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance.
*   The goal is to provide clients with reliable and comparable investment performance data.
*   Firms can claim GIPS compliance on a firm-wide basis, not for specific products.

This overview provides a foundational understanding. Each standard has nuances and is often tested through situational ethics questions. Consistent review and application of these principles are key to success.
Remember to consult the `Global_Financial_Glossary.md` for definitions of key terms.
