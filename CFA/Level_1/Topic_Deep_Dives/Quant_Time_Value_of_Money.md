## Overview

This document provides a deep dive into the concepts of Time Value of Money (TVM) as required for the CFA Level I exam. Understanding TVM is fundamental to financial analysis and valuation.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will cover key concepts such as present value, future value, annuities, perpetuities, and their applications.)*

## Key Concepts

*   **Present Value (PV):** The current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.
*   **Future Value (FV):** The value of an asset or cash at a specified date in the future based on an assumed rate of growth.
*   **Interest Rates (r):** The rate of return that reflects the time value of money.
*   **Number of Periods (n):** The total number of compounding periods.
*   **Annuities:** A series of equal payments made at equal intervals for a specified period.
*   **Perpetuities:** An annuity that continues indefinitely.

## Formulas

*   FV = PV * (1 + r)^n
*   PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

*(More formulas and examples will be added here.)*

## Applications
