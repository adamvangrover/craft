# Equity Investments: Introduction to Valuation Models (Level I)

## Overview

This document introduces fundamental equity valuation models covered in the CFA Level I curriculum. Equity valuation is the process of determining the intrinsic value of a company's stock.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will cover Dividend Discount Models (DDM), Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) models, and relative valuation multiples like P/E, P/B, and P/S.)*

## Core Valuation Concepts

*   **Intrinsic Value:** The true, inherent worth of an asset, based on its underlying characteristics and cash-flow generating potential.
*   **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Models:** Value an asset based on the present value of its expected future cash flows.
    *   **Dividend Discount Model (DDM):** Values a stock based on the present value of its expected future dividends.
    *   **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) Model:** Values a stock based on the present value of cash flows available to equity holders after all expenses, reinvestment, and debt payments.
*   **Relative Valuation (Multiples):** Values a stock by comparing its price multiples (e.g., P/E ratio) to those of comparable companies or industry benchmarks.

## Key Models and Formulas

*   **Gordon Growth Model (Constant Growth DDM):** V0 = D1 / (k - g)
    *   V0 = Value of stock today
    *   D1 = Expected dividend next period
    *   k = Required rate of return on equity
    *   g = Constant growth rate of dividends
*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share
*   **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:** Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
*   **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Market Price per Share / Sales per Share

*(More detailed explanations of multi-stage models, FCFE calculations, and the application of multiples will be added here.)*

## Applications and Limitations

*   Understanding the assumptions and limitations of each model.
*   Choosing the appropriate model based on company characteristics and data availability.
