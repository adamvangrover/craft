## Overview

This document provides a detailed exploration of Income Statement analysis for the CFA Level I exam. The income statement is a critical financial statement that shows a company's financial performance over a specific period.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will cover revenue recognition, expense classification, non-recurring items, and earnings per share.)*

## Key Components of the Income Statement

*   **Revenue (Sales):** Inflow of economic benefits during the period arising from the course of ordinary activities.
*   **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold.
*   **Gross Profit:** Revenue - COGS.
*   **Operating Expenses:** Expenses incurred through normal business operations (e.g., Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A), Research & Development (R&D)).
*   **Operating Income (EBIT):** Gross Profit - Operating Expenses.
*   **Interest Expense:** Cost of borrowed funds.
*   **Tax Expense:** Taxes owed by the company.
*   **Net Income (Net Earnings):** The "bottom line" profit after all expenses and taxes.

## Key Analytical Considerations

*   **Revenue Recognition Principles:** Understanding when and how revenue is recognized (e.g., percentage of completion, completed contract).
*   **Expense Analysis:** Classifying expenses (operating vs. non-operating, fixed vs. variable) and analyzing trends.
*   **Non-Recurring Items:** Identifying and adjusting for items that are not expected to persist (e.g., gains/losses from asset sales, restructuring charges).
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Basic EPS and Diluted EPS calculations and interpretations.
*   **Common-Size Analysis:** Expressing income statement items as a percentage of revenue to facilitate comparison.
