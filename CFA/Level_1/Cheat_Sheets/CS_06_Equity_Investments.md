# CFA Level 1 Cheat Sheet: Equity Investments

## Key Concepts:

### Market Organization and Structure
- **Financial System Functions:** Saving, borrowing, issuing equity, risk management, exchanging assets, information.
- **Assets:** Real assets, financial assets (debt, equity, derivatives).
- **Markets:**
  - **Primary Market:** New issuance of securities (IPOs, SEOs).
  - **Secondary Market:** Trading of existing securities.
  - **Money Market vs. Capital Market.**
- **Positions:**
  - **Long:** Owns the asset, benefits from price increase.
  - **Short:** Borrows and sells asset, benefits from price decrease. (Margin requirements, short covering).
- **Order Types:** Market order, limit order, stop order (stop-loss, stop-buy).
- **Market Structures:**
  - **Quote-Driven (Dealer) Markets:** Dealers post bid/ask prices.
  - **Order-Driven Markets:** Buyers/sellers submit orders (order matching rules).
  - **Brokered Markets:** Brokers find counterparties.
- **Well-Functioning Financial System:** Complete markets, operational efficiency, informational efficiency.

### Security Market Indexes
- **Purpose:** Reflection of market sentiment, benchmark for performance, measure of market return, basis for investment products.
- **Index Construction Decisions:**
  - **Target Market:** Broad market, specific sector, style.
  - **Security Selection:** Which securities to include.
- **Index Weighting Methods:**
  - **Price-Weighted:** Average price of constituent stocks (e.g., DJIA). Stock splits require divisor adjustment.
  - **Equal-Weighted:** Equal dollar amount invested in each stock. Requires rebalancing.
  - **Market-Capitalization-Weighted:** Weighted by market cap of constituents (e.g., S&P 500). Most common. Does not need adjustment for splits/dividends.
  - **Float-Adjusted Market-Cap Weighted:** Based on shares available for public trading.
  - **Fundamental-Weighted:** Based on fundamentals like earnings, dividends, book value.
- **Index Rebalancing and Reconstitution.**
- **Types of Equity Indexes:** Broad market, multi-market, sector, style (growth vs. value, small-cap vs. large-cap).
- **Fixed Income and Alternative Asset Indexes also exist.**

### Market Efficiency
- **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH):** Asset prices fully reflect all available information.
- **Forms of Market Efficiency:**
  - **Weak Form:** Prices reflect all past market data (price, volume). Technical analysis is not profitable.
  - **Semi-Strong Form:** Prices reflect all publicly available information. Fundamental analysis is not profitable.
  - **Strong Form:** Prices reflect all information (public and private). Insider trading is not profitable.
- **Market Anomalies:** Patterns that seem to contradict EMH (e.g., January effect, size effect, value effect). Often debated if they are persistent or due to risk misspecification.
- **Behavioral Finance:** Explains anomalies through investor psychology and cognitive biases (e.g., loss aversion, overconfidence, herding).

### Overview of Equity Securities
- **Common Stock:** Residual claim, voting rights, limited liability.
- **Preferred Stock:** Fixed dividend (usually), priority over common stock in dividends and liquidation.
  - **Cumulative vs. Non-cumulative.**
  - **Participating vs. Non-participating.**
  - **Convertible Preferred Stock.**
- **Private Equity:**
  - **Venture Capital:** Early-stage financing.
  - **Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs):** Using debt to buy established companies.
  - **Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPEs).**
- **Foreign Equities:**
  - **Direct Investing.**
  - **Depository Receipts (DRs):**
    - **American Depository Receipts (ADRs):** Trade in the US. (Sponsored vs. Unsponsored, Levels I, II, III).
    - **Global Depository Receipts (GDRs).**
- **Risk and Return of Equity Securities:** Higher risk and higher expected return than debt.

### Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis
- **Uses of Industry Analysis:** Understanding company's business environment, identifying active investment opportunities, portfolio performance attribution.
- **Approaches to Grouping Companies:**
  - **Products and Services.**
  - **Business Cycle Sensitivities:** Cyclical vs. Non-cyclical (Defensive).
  - **Statistical Similarities.**
- **Industry Classification Systems:** GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard), RGS (Russell Global Sectors), ICB (Industry Classification Benchmark).
- **Porter's Five Forces (Industry Structure Analysis):**
  1.  **Intra-industry rivalry.**
  2.  **Threat of new entrants.**
  3.  **Threat of substitutes.**
  4.  **Bargaining power of suppliers.**
  5.  **Bargaining power of buyers.**
- **Industry Life Cycle:** Embryonic, Growth, Shakeout, Mature, Decline.
- **Macroeconomic Factors:** GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, exchange rates.
- **Company Analysis:** Competitive strategy (cost leadership vs. differentiation), financial performance, management quality.

### Equity Valuation: Concepts and Basic Tools
- **Intrinsic Value (V0):** Rational value of an asset based on fundamental analysis.
- **Market Price (P0):** Current price in the market.
- **Investment Decision:** If V0 > P0 (buy), V0 < P0 (sell/short), V0 = P0 (hold).
- **Valuation Models:**
  - **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Models (Present Value Models):**
    - **Dividend Discount Model (DDM):**
      - **One-Period DDM:** V0 = (D1 + P1) / (1 + ke)
      - **Gordon Growth Model (Constant Growth DDM):** V0 = D1 / (ke - g)
        - D1 = D0 * (1 + g)
        - ke = required rate of return on equity
        - g = constant dividend growth rate (g = ROE * retention rate)
        - Assumes ke > g.
      - **Multi-stage DDM:** For companies with non-constant growth.
    - **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) Model:** V0 = Σ [FCFEt / (1 + ke)^t]
      - FCFE = CFO - Fixed Capital Investment + Net Borrowing
  - **Multiplier Models (Relative Valuation Models):**
    - **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** P0 / E1 (Leading P/E) or P0 / E0 (Trailing P/E).
      - Justified P/E = (D1/E1) / (ke - g) = Payout Ratio / (ke - g)
    - **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:** P0 / BVPS
      - Justified P/B = (ROE - g) / (ke - g)
    - **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** P0 / SPS
      - Justified P/S = (Net Profit Margin * Payout Ratio * (1+g)) / (ke-g)
    - **Enterprise Value (EV) / EBITDA:** EV = Market Cap + Market Value of Debt - Cash & Equivalents.
    - **Dividend Yield:** D1 / P0
  - **Asset-Based Valuation Models:** Value based on market value of company's assets minus liabilities.

## Formulas to Memorize:
- **Gordon Growth Model:** V0 = D1 / (ke - g)
- **D1:** D0 * (1 + g)
- **Sustainable Growth Rate (g):** ROE * b (where b = retention rate = 1 - payout ratio)
- **ke (from CAPM):** Rf + β * (Equity Risk Premium)
- **P/E Ratio:** Stock Price / Earnings Per Share
- **Justified Leading P/E:** (D1/E1) / (ke - g)  OR  Payout Ratio / (ke - g)
- **P/B Ratio:** Stock Price / Book Value Per Share
- **P/S Ratio:** Stock Price / Sales Per Share
- **Dividend Yield:** Annual Dividend Per Share / Stock Price
- **FCFE:** CFO - FCInv + Net Borrowing  OR NI + NCC - FCInv - WCInv + Net Borrowing

## Common Pitfalls & Tips:
- **Index Weighting:** Understand how different weighting schemes affect index values and require rebalancing.
- **EMH:** Distinguish clearly between the three forms and their implications.
- **Valuation Models:**
  - Know the assumptions and limitations of each model.
  - Gordon Growth Model is very sensitive to inputs (ke and g).
  - Use consistent inputs (e.g., if using trailing EPS for P/E, compare to other trailing P/Es).
- **Private vs. Public Equity:** Understand the differences in liquidity, disclosure, and valuation challenges.
