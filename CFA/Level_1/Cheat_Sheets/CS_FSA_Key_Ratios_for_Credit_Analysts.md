# CFA Level 1 Cheat Sheet: Key FSA Ratios for Credit Analysts

**Purpose:** This cheat sheet consolidates financial ratios from various categories that are particularly crucial for credit analysis. It emphasizes interpretation from a creditor's viewpoint. For detailed formulas and broader context, refer to the main FSA and Corporate Issuers (Corporate Finance) curriculum.

## I. Liquidity Ratios
*Measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations (due within one year).*

| Ratio                             | Formula                                                       | Credit Analyst Interpretation                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Current Ratio**                 | `Current Assets / Current Liabilities`                        | Indicates how many times CA cover CL. Generally, >1x is preferred. Too high might be inefficient; too low signals risk.         |
| **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test)**       | `(Cash + Marketable Sec. + Accts. Receivable) / Current Liab.` | Stricter liquidity test, excludes less-liquid inventory. >1x is a good sign.                                                |
| **Cash Ratio**                    | `(Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities`        | Most conservative liquidity measure; ability to pay CL with most liquid assets.                                                |
| **Defensive Interval Ratio**      | `(Cash + Market. Sec. + AR) / Avg. Daily Expenditures`        | How many days the company can operate without needing external cash inflows. `Avg. Daily Exp = (COGS + OpEx - NonCash) / 365` |
| **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)**   | `DSO + DIH - DPO`                                             | Time taken to convert investment in inventory back into cash. Shorter is better. A lengthening CCC is a warning sign for cash flow. |
|   *Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)*  | `(Avg. AR / Revenue) * 365`                                   | Average collection period. Rising DSO can signal collection issues.                                                          |
|   *Days Inventory Held (DIH)*     | `(Avg. Inventory / COGS) * 365`                               | Average days inventory is held. Rising DIH can mean obsolescence/slow sales.                                                 |
|   *Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)*| `(Avg. AP / COGS) * 365`                                      | Average time to pay suppliers. Stretching payables can be a cash source or sign of distress.                                 |

**Credit Analyst Focus (Liquidity):**
*   Adequate liquidity to cover maturing short-term debt and operational needs.
*   Trends in ratios are more important than absolute numbers.
*   Compare to industry peers.
*   Understand working capital efficiency (CCC).

## II. Solvency & Leverage Ratios
*Measures a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations and its overall financial risk related to debt.*

| Ratio                               | Formula                                                      | Credit Analyst Interpretation                                                                                                |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Debt-to-Assets Ratio**            | `Total Debt / Total Assets`                                  | Proportion of assets financed by debt. Higher = more risk.                                                                   |
| **Debt-to-Capital Ratio**           | `Total Debt / (Total Debt + Total Equity)`                   | Proportion of capital structure financed by debt. Higher = more risk.                                                        |
| **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**            | `Total Debt / Total Equity`                                  | How much debt per dollar of equity. Higher = more financial leverage and risk.                                             |
| **Financial Leverage Ratio**        | `Average Total Assets / Average Total Equity`                | Measures how many times assets are a multiple of equity. Higher = more leverage.                                           |
| *(Commonly used by credit analysts, though not always in L1 curriculum explicitly as "leverage")* |                                                              |                                                                                                                              |
| **Total Debt / EBITDA**             | `(Short-Term Debt + Long-Term Debt) / EBITDA`                | How many years of EBITDA to repay all debt. A key leverage metric in credit agreements. (EBITDA often adjusted by lenders). |

**Credit Analyst Focus (Solvency/Leverage):**
*   Assess if debt levels are sustainable given the company's cash flow generation and industry.
*   High leverage amplifies risk; small declines in operating performance can severely impact debt service capacity.
*   Understand the composition and maturity profile of debt (not just total amount).
*   Equity provides a cushion for debtholders.

## III. Coverage Ratios
*Measures a company's ability to meet its interest and other fixed charge payments.*

| Ratio                             | Formula                                                                 | Credit Analyst Interpretation                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interest Coverage Ratio (TIE)** | `EBIT / Interest Expense`                                               | How many times operating income can cover interest payments. Higher is better. Below 1.5x-2.0x is often a concern.                                          |
| **EBITDA Coverage Ratio**         | `EBITDA / Interest Expense`                                             | Similar to TIE, but uses EBITDA (adds back D&A). Often higher than TIE.                                                                                  |
| **Fixed Charge Coverage (FCCR)**  | `(EBIT + Lease Payments) / (Interest Exp. + Lease Payments)`            | Broader measure including lease payments (important as leases are debt-like). (Level 1 might simplify this or use a variant).                            |
| *(More comprehensive FCCR often seen in practice, using (EBITDA - Maintenance CapEx) / (Interest + Scheduled Principal Repayments + Lease Payments), but L1 focuses on simpler versions)* |                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                          |

**Credit Analyst Focus (Coverage):**
*   Direct measure of ability to service debt payments from operating earnings/cash flow.
*   Crucial for assessing default risk. Declining coverage ratios are a major red flag.
*   Ensure the "EBIT" or "EBITDA" used is sustainable and adjusted for non-recurring items.

## IV. Profitability Ratios
*Measures a company's ability to generate profits from its sales and assets. Consistent profitability supports debt repayment.*

| Ratio                       | Formula                                         | Credit Analyst Interpretation                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gross Profit Margin**     | `Gross Profit / Revenue`                        | Efficiency of production/service delivery. Stable or improving margins are positive.                                        |
| **Operating Profit Margin** | `Operating Income (EBIT) / Revenue`             | Profitability from core business operations. Reflects pricing power and operating expense control.                          |
| **Net Profit Margin**       | `Net Income / Revenue`                          | Overall profitability after all expenses, including interest and taxes.                                                   |
| **Return on Assets (ROA)**  | `Net Income / Average Total Assets`             | How efficiently assets are used to generate profit. (Variants: EBIT/Avg Total Assets for pre-financing view).             |
| **Return on Equity (ROE)**  | `Net Income / Average Total Equity`             | Return generated for shareholders. High ROE driven by high leverage (rather than high ROA) can be risky for creditors.       |
| *(ROE can be decomposed using DuPont Analysis: `(NI/Rev) * (Rev/AvgAssets) * (AvgAssets/AvgEquity) = NPM * Asset Turnover * Leverage`)* |                                                 |                                                                                                                           |

**Credit Analyst Focus (Profitability):**
*   Sustainable profitability is essential for long-term debt repayment.
*   Analyze trends in margins â€“ are they stable, improving, or deteriorating? Why?
*   High profitability can provide a buffer against unexpected shocks.

**General Tips for Credit Analysts Using Ratios:**
*   **Trends Over Time:** Analyze ratios over several periods (e.g., 3-5 years) to identify trends and patterns.
*   **Peer Comparison:** Benchmark the company's ratios against those of its direct competitors and industry averages.
*   **Understand the Drivers:** Don't just calculate ratios; understand what business factors are driving them.
*   **Quality of Inputs:** Ensure the financial statement data used for ratios is reliable (consider accounting policies, non-recurring items).
*   **Ratios Tell a Story:** Use a combination of ratios from different categories to build a holistic picture of credit risk. No single ratio is sufficient.
*   **Footnotes are Crucial:** Always read the financial statement footnotes for important context and disclosures that can impact ratio interpretation.
