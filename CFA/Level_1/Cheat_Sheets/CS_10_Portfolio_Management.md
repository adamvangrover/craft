# Cheat Sheet: Portfolio Management

## Key Concepts
- **Asset Allocation:** The process of dividing a portfolio among different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.
- **Diversification:** The practice of spreading investments among different assets to reduce risk.
- **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT):** A theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward.
- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):** A model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks.
- **Efficient Frontier:** The set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

## Formulas
- **Expected Return of a Portfolio:** E(Rp) = w1*E(R1) + w2*E(R2) + ... + wn*E(Rn)
- **Variance of a Two-Asset Portfolio:** Var(Rp) = w1^2*σ1^2 + w2^2*σ2^2 + 2*w1*w2*Cov(R1,R2)
- **CAPM:** E(Ri) = Rf + βi * (E(Rm) - Rf)

## Key Terms
- **Alpha:** A measure of the active return on an investment, the performance of that investment compared with a suitable benchmark.
- **Beta:** A measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure of risk-adjusted return. It describes how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure for holding a riskier asset.
- **Sortino Ratio:** A variation of the Sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns—downside deviation—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns.
- **Treynor Ratio:** A ratio of the excess return of a portfolio to its beta. It is a measure of the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio.
