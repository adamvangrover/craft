### Characteristics of Alternative Investments (General)

- **Diversification Benefits:** Potentially low correlation with traditional asset classes.
- **Due Diligence Complexity:** Requires specialized knowledge to evaluate managers and strategies.

### Hedge Funds

  - **Incentive (Performance) Fee:** % of profits, e.g., 20%.
  - **Hurdle Rate:** Minimum return manager must achieve before incentive fees are paid. (Soft vs. Hard hurdle rate).
  - **High-Water Mark (HWM):** Incentive fees are only paid on new profits above the highest previous fund value.
- **Lock-up Periods and Redemption Notice Periods:** Restrict liquidity.

### Private Equity
- **Investment Stages (Venture Capital):** Seed, Start-up, Early Stage, Later Stage.
- **LBO Characteristics:** High leverage, focus on operational improvements, exit strategy (IPO, sale to strategic buyer, secondary buyout).
- **Valuation:** More complex due to illiquidity and lack of public comparables. Methods include DCF, relative value, asset-based.
- **Exit Strategies:** IPO, trade sale (to another company), secondary buyout (to another PE firm), management buyout, liquidation.
- **J-Curve Effect:** PE fund returns are often negative in early years due to fees and underperforming investments, then improve.

### Real Estate
- **Investment Categories:** Residential, Commercial (office, retail, industrial), REITs, Timberland/Farmland.
- **Valuation Approaches:**
  - **Comparable Sales Approach:** Based on prices of similar recently sold properties.
  - **Income Approach:** PV of future income (Net Operating Income / Cap Rate).
  - **Cost Approach:** Replacement cost minus depreciation.
- **Net Operating Income (NOI):** Potential Gross Income - Vacancy/Collection Loss + Other Income - Operating Expenses (excluding financing and taxes).
- **Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate):** NOI / Property Value. (Used as a discount rate or valuation multiple).
- **REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts):** Publicly traded companies that own and operate income-producing real estate. Offer liquidity and diversification.

### Commodities
- **Sources of Return:** Spot price changes, collateral yield (interest earned on margin), roll yield (from futures contracts).
- **Contango:** Futures Price > Spot Price (F > S). Negative roll yield for long positions.

- **Commodity Indexes:** Often based on futures contracts.
- **Motivations for Investing:** Inflation hedge, diversification.

- **Private Equity:** J-curve, vintage year, carried interest (incentive fee for PE).
- **Real Estate:** NOI, Cap Rate.
- **Commodities:** Contango, Backwardation, Roll Yield, Collateral Yield.
- **Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio:** Often used to evaluate risk-adjusted returns, though may have limitations with non-normal return distributions of alternatives.

## Common Pitfalls & Tips:
- **Diversification is Not Guaranteed:** Correlations can change, especially during market stress.
- **Illiquidity Premium:** Expect higher returns for bearing illiquidity, but this is not always realized.
- **Fees Impact Returns Significantly:** Understand the fee structure and its potential drag on net returns.
- **Data Biases:**
  - **Survivorship Bias:** Failed funds are excluded from historical performance databases.
  - **Backfill Bias (Inclusion Bias):** Funds may only report performance once they are successful.
  - **Infrequent Trading/Appraisal Data:** Can smooth returns and understate volatility.
- **Alternative investments are not a homogenous asset class.** Each category and strategy has unique characteristics.
