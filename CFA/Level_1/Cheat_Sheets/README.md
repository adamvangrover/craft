# CFA Level 1: Cheat Sheets Collection

## Purpose of This Section

This directory houses a collection of "cheat sheets" for the CFA Level 1 exam. These are concise summaries of key concepts, formulas, definitions, and important lists for various topic areas within the Level 1 curriculum.

**The goal of these cheat sheets is to:**

*   Provide a quick reference for core material.
*   Aid in memorization of essential formulas and facts.
*   Serve as a high-level review tool, especially in the later stages of exam preparation.
*   Help identify areas that may require further in-depth study in the official curriculum or detailed notes.

**Important Note:** These cheat sheets are intended as a **supplement** to, not a replacement for, comprehensive study of the CFA Program curriculum. True understanding comes from engaging with the full material and practicing a wide range of questions.

*(Developer Note: The presence of two files named `CS_07_...` (Derivatives and Fixed Income) suggests a potential numbering inconsistency if a strict sequential topic order (e.g., matching CFA curriculum topic order) was intended. The `CFA/index.html` materials library also reflects these names. For now, all existing files are listed. Future cleanup might involve re-numbering for strict sequence if desired, ensuring all links are updated accordingly.)*

## How to Best Use These Cheat Sheets

*   **Post-Study Review:** Use them after you have already studied a topic area in detail using the curriculum or your primary study notes. They are not meant for initial learning.
*   **Formula Memorization:** Keep relevant formula sheets handy for quick recall practice.
*   **Final Revision:** In the weeks leading up to the exam, these can be invaluable for rapidly reviewing a large volume of material.
*   **Identify Weaknesses:** If you find yourself struggling with concepts on a cheat sheet, itâ€™s a sign you need to revisit that section in more detail.
*   **Credit Analysis Connection:**
    *   **Student Tip:** As you review, actively think about how each concept connects to credit analysis. For example, when reviewing FSA ratios, consider which are most critical for assessing a company's solvency and liquidity from a creditor's perspective. When looking at Corporate Finance (Corporate Issuers) concepts like WACC or capital structure, think about how a company's financing decisions impact its risk profile and bondholders.
    *   **Teacher Note:** Encourage students to create their own "credit analyst annotations" on these cheat sheets, highlighting the most relevant takeaways for risk assessment.

## Enhancing This Collection

This collection can always be improved and expanded. Contributions are welcome! Consider developing:

*   **New Cheat Sheets:** For specific readings or sub-topics not yet covered.
*   **Enhanced Cheat Sheets:** Adding more detail, mnemonics, or examples to existing ones.
*   **"Credit Analyst's View" Cheat Sheets:** Perhaps a specialized version of an FSA cheat sheet that specifically highlights ratios and concepts most pertinent to credit risk, or a Fixed Income cheat sheet that emphasizes credit-sensitive aspects.
*   **Visual Aids:** Simple diagrams or flowcharts that can be incorporated.

When contributing, please aim for:
*   **Conciseness:** It's a "cheat sheet," not a textbook chapter.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure formulas and definitions align with the CFA curriculum.
*   **Clarity:** Easy to read and understand.
*   **Relevance:** Focus on the most testable and important concepts for Level 1.

By working together, we can make this a highly effective resource for all CFA Level 1 candidates in our team, particularly those aiming to excel in credit risk analysis.
