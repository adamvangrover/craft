# Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this directory and its subdirectories.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the overall repository structure, formatting, and writing style. Refer to the main `README.md` and other `AGENTS.MD` files for examples.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Cheat sheets must be concise by nature, but also clear. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Follow standard Markdown syntax. Use tables, lists, and emphasis effectively for summarization.
*   **Accuracy:** Formulas, definitions, and key facts must be accurate and align with the CFA Institute Level 1 curriculum.
*   **File Naming:** Use the `CS_Topic_Name.md` convention. If numbered, ensure consistency or note discrepancies (e.g., the `CS_07_...` files).
*   **Links:**
    *   Use relative links if linking to other cheat sheets or local resources.
    *   Verify that all links are functional.
*   **Updating Navigation:** When adding new cheat sheets:
    *   Ensure `CFA/Level_1/Cheat_Sheets/README.md` is updated to list the new file.
    *   Ensure `CFA/Level_1/Cheat_Sheets/index.html` has the new file listed in its `filesInDir` JavaScript array.
    *   Notify or update `CFA/index.html` (Materials Library section) and `CFA/Level_1/README.md` to reflect new cheat sheets.
*   **Review:** Before submitting changes, review your work for adherence to these guidelines and the specific task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: CFA Level 1 Cheat Sheets

### Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from `CFA/Level_1/AGENTS.MD`, `CFA/AGENTS.MD`, and the root `AGENTS.MD`. Please review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_1/Cheat_Sheets/` directory provides concise summaries of key concepts, formulas, and definitions for CFA Level 1 topic areas. They are intended for quick review and memorization aid.

The introductory guide for this section is `CFA/Level_1/Cheat_Sheets/README.md`.
Individual cheat sheets are `.md` files.
Navigation is also supported by `CFA/Level_1/Cheat_Sheets/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure for Cheat Sheets
Each cheat sheet should:
*   Clearly state the topic area it covers.
*   Use headings, bullet points, tables, and other formatting to present information in an easily digestible format.
*   Prioritize essential formulas, definitions, and key lists/concepts that are frequently tested or crucial for understanding.
*   Be self-contained for its specific topic but can reference other topics if highly relevant.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 1 Cheat Sheet Content
*   **Brevity:** Focus on the most critical information. Avoid lengthy explanations; these belong in "Deep Dive" sections.
*   **Curriculum Alignment:** Ensure the content directly supports Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) from the Level 1 curriculum.
*   **Formula Presentation:** Present formulas clearly. Define all variables used.
*   **No Redundancy with Glossary:** While key terms may be defined, avoid extensive re-definition if the term is (or should be) in the `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.

Refer to parent `AGENTS.MD` files for broader CFA and repository guidelines.
