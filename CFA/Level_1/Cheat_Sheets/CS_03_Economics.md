# CFA Level 1 Cheat Sheet: Economics

## Key Concepts:

### Demand and Supply Analysis: Introduction
- **Demand Curve:** Relationship between price and quantity demanded. (Law of Demand: inverse relationship)
- **Supply Curve:** Relationship between price and quantity supplied. (Law of Supply: positive relationship)
- **Market Equilibrium:** Price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.
- **Elasticity:**
  - **Own-Price Elasticity of Demand:** %ΔQd / %ΔP
    - Elastic (>1), Inelastic (<1), Unit Elastic (=1), Perfectly Elastic (∞), Perfectly Inelastic (0)
  - **Income Elasticity of Demand:** %ΔQd / %ΔI (Normal goods > 0, Inferior goods < 0)
  - **Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand:** %ΔQdx / %ΔPy (Substitutes > 0, Complements < 0)
- **Consumer Surplus & Producer Surplus.**

### Demand and Supply Analysis: Consumer Demand
- **Utility Theory:**
  - Total Utility vs. Marginal Utility.
  - Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility.
- **Indifference Curves & Budget Constraints.**
  - Optimal consumption point.
- **Substitution Effect & Income Effect.**

### Demand and Supply Analysis: The Firm
- **Production Function:** Relationship between inputs and output.
- **Short-Run vs. Long-Run Production.**
- **Costs:**
  - Total Cost (TC), Total Fixed Cost (TFC), Total Variable Cost (TVC).
  - Average Cost (AC), Average Fixed Cost (AFC), Average Variable Cost (AVC).
  - Marginal Cost (MC).
- **Revenue:**
  - Total Revenue (TR), Average Revenue (AR), Marginal Revenue (MR).
- **Profit Maximization:** MR = MC.

### Market Structures
- **Perfect Competition:** Many firms, identical products, no barriers to entry, price takers. (P = MR = MC = AC in LR equilibrium)
- **Monopolistic Competition:** Many firms, differentiated products, low barriers to entry.
- **Oligopoly:** Few firms, interdependent, high barriers to entry. (Kinked demand curve, Cournot, Nash equilibrium)
- **Monopoly:** Single firm, unique product, high barriers to entry, price setter. (MR < P)
- **Measures of Market Concentration:** N-firm concentration ratio, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).

### Aggregate Output, Prices, and Economic Growth
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** Total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.
  - Expenditure Approach: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
  - Income Approach: GDP = National Income + Capital Consumption Allowance + Statistical Discrepancy
- **Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP.** (Real GDP adjusted for inflation)
- **GDP Deflator:** (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100
- **Aggregate Demand (AD) & Aggregate Supply (AS):**
  - AD: C + I + G + (X - M)
  - SRAS: Upward sloping.
  - LRAS: Vertical at potential GDP.
- **Sources of Economic Growth:** Labor supply, human capital, physical capital, technology, natural resources.

### Business Cycles
- **Phases:** Expansion, Peak, Contraction (Recession), Trough.
- **Indicators:** Leading, Coincident, Lagging.
- **Theories:** Neoclassical, Keynesian, Monetarist, Austrian, New Classical (Real Business Cycle).

### Monetary and Fiscal Policy
- **Monetary Policy:** Actions by central bank to influence money supply and credit.
  - Tools: Open market operations, policy rate (e.g., Fed Funds Rate, discount rate), reserve requirements.
  - Expansionary (loosen) vs. Contractionary (tighten).
  - Quantity Theory of Money: MV = PY
- **Fiscal Policy:** Use of government spending and taxation to influence aggregate demand.
  - Tools: Government spending, taxes, transfer payments.
  - Expansionary vs. Contractionary.
  - Fiscal Multiplier.
- **Relationship between Monetary and Fiscal Policy.**
- **Limitations of Policies:** Lags, crowding-out effect.

### International Trade and Capital Flows
- **Comparative Advantage vs. Absolute Advantage.**
- **Trade Restrictions:** Tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, voluntary export restraints.
- **Balance of Payments (BOP):** Current Account, Capital Account, Financial Account.
  - Current Account = (X - M) + Net Income + Net Unilateral Transfers

### Currency Exchange Rates
- **Nominal vs. Real Exchange Rates.**
- **Spot Rates vs. Forward Rates.**
- **Exchange Rate Regimes:** Fixed, Floating, Managed Float.
- **Factors influencing exchange rates:** Inflation differentials, interest rate differentials, economic growth, government policies, market sentiment.

## Common Pitfalls & Tips:
- **Elasticity Signs:** Remember the typical signs for different types of elasticities.
- **Market Structures:** Clearly differentiate the characteristics and outcomes of each structure.
- **GDP Components:** Understand what's included/excluded in GDP calculations.
- **AD/AS Shifts:** Know the factors that shift AD and AS curves and their impact on price level and output.
- **Policy Tools:** Be clear on how each monetary and fiscal policy tool works and its intended effect.
- **Exchange Rates:** Direct vs. Indirect quotes. Appreciation vs. Depreciation.
