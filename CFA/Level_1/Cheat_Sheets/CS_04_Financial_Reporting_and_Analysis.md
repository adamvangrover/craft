# CFA Level 1 Cheat Sheet: Financial Reporting and Analysis (FRA)

## Key Concepts:

### Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis
- **Objective of Financial Reporting:** Provide information useful for making decisions by investors and creditors.
- **Standard-Setting Bodies:** FASB (US GAAP), IASB (IFRS).
- **Regulatory Authorities:** SEC (US), ESMA (Europe), etc.
- **Frameworks:** Conceptual Framework (qualitative characteristics, elements of financial statements).

### Financial Reporting Standards
- **Key IFRS vs. US GAAP Differences:** (e.g., inventory valuation, impairment, development costs).
- **Reconciliation not required but understanding differences is key.**

### Understanding Income Statements
- **Revenue Recognition:** (IFRS 15 / ASC 606) - 5 step model.
- **Expense Recognition:** Matching principle.
- **Components:** Gross Profit, Operating Profit, Net Income.
- **Non-recurring items:** Discontinued operations, unusual or infrequent items.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Basic EPS, Diluted EPS.

### Understanding Balance Sheets
- **Assets = Liabilities + Equity (A = L + E).**
- **Current vs. Non-current Assets/Liabilities.**
- **Measurement Bases:** Historical cost, amortized cost, fair value.
- **Specific Asset Accounts:**
  - Cash & Cash Equivalents
  - Accounts Receivable (Net Realizable Value)
  - Inventory (LIFO, FIFO, Weighted-Average Cost - LIFO not allowed under IFRS)
  - Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) (Cost model, Revaluation model under IFRS)
  - Intangible Assets (Goodwill, patents, trademarks)
- **Specific Liability Accounts:**
  - Accounts Payable
  - Accrued Expenses
  - Debt (Bonds Payable, Notes Payable)
  - Deferred Tax Liabilities
- **Equity Accounts:**
  - Contributed Capital (Common Stock, Preferred Stock, APIC)
  - Retained Earnings
  - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)
  - Treasury Stock

### Understanding Cash Flow Statements
- **Purpose:** Show sources and uses of cash.
- **Sections:**
  - **Operating Activities (CFO):**
    - Direct Method (cash collected from customers, cash paid to suppliers/employees).
    - Indirect Method (starts with Net Income, adjusts for non-cash items and changes in working capital). IFRS encourages direct, US GAAP permits either.
  - **Investing Activities (CFI):** Purchase/sale of long-term assets (PP&E, intangibles), investments.
  - **Financing Activities (CFF):** Debt, equity, dividends paid.
- **Linkages between statements.**

### Financial Analysis Techniques
- **Ratio Analysis:**
  - **Activity Ratios:** (Inventory turnover, receivables turnover, payables turnover, asset turnover)
  - **Liquidity Ratios:** (Current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio)
  - **Solvency Ratios:** (Debt-to-equity, debt-to-assets, interest coverage ratio)
  - **Profitability Ratios:** (Net profit margin, gross profit margin, operating profit margin, ROA, ROE)
  - **Valuation Ratios:** (P/E, P/S, P/B, Dividend yield)
- **DuPont Analysis:** Decomposes ROE (ROE = Net Profit Margin * Asset Turnover * Equity Multiplier)
- **Common-Size Analysis:** Vertical (shows items as % of sales/assets) and Horizontal (shows % change over time).
- **Segment Analysis.**
- **Forecasting Financial Statements.**

### Inventories
- **Costing Methods:** FIFO, LIFO (US GAAP only), Weighted-Average.
- **Impact of methods on COGS, Net Income, Inventory Balance (during rising/falling prices).**
- **Inventory Valuation:** Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value (IFRS & US GAAP FIFO/Avg). Lower of Cost or Market (US GAAP LIFO).
- **LIFO Reserve:** Difference between LIFO inventory and FIFO inventory.

### Long-Lived Assets
- **Capitalizing vs. Expensing.**
- **Depreciation Methods:** Straight-line, diminishing balance (double-declining), units-of-production.
- **Impairment:**
  - IFRS: Recoverable amount (higher of value in use or fair value less costs to sell) < Carrying amount.
  - US GAAP: Two-step process for assets held for use.
- **Revaluation Model (IFRS only for PP&E and some intangibles).**
- **Derecognition (Sale of Assets).**

### Income Taxes
- **Current Tax Expense vs. Income Tax Payable.**
- **Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) and Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTLs):** Arise from temporary differences between accounting profit and taxable income.
- **Tax Base:** Amount of an asset or liability for tax purposes.
- **Valuation Allowance (for DTAs - US GAAP).**

### Non-Current (Long-Term) Liabilities
- **Bonds Payable:**
  - Issuance at par, premium, discount.
  - Effective Interest Method for amortization.
  - Derecognition of debt.
- **Leases:**
  - **Lessee Accounting:**
    - IFRS 16: Single model - finance lease (recognize ROU asset and lease liability).
    - US GAAP: Finance lease vs. Operating lease.
  - **Lessor Accounting:** (Similar under IFRS and US GAAP) - Sales-type lease, direct financing lease, operating lease.

### Financial Reporting Quality
- **High-Quality Reporting:** Decision-useful, relevant, faithfully representative.
- **Low-Quality Reporting:** Biased, earnings management.
- **Warning Signs:** Revenue recognition issues, expense recognition issues, aggressive accounting policies.

## Formulas to Memorize (Examples):
- **Basic EPS:** (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Avg. Common Shares Outstanding
- **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- **Quick Ratio:** (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables) / Current Liabilities
- **Inventory Turnover:** COGS / Average Inventory
- **Receivables Turnover:** Credit Sales / Average Receivables
- **Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO):** 365 / Receivables Turnover
- **Debt-to-Equity:** Total Debt / Total Equity
- **Interest Coverage Ratio:** EBIT / Interest Expense
- **Net Profit Margin:** Net Income / Revenue
- **ROA:** Net Income / Average Total Assets
- **ROE (DuPont):** (Net Income/Sales) * (Sales/Avg Total Assets) * (Avg Total Assets/Avg Total Equity)

## Common Pitfalls & Tips:
- **IFRS vs. US GAAP:** Know the key differences, especially for inventory, long-lived assets, and leases.
- **Indirect CFO:** Master the adjustments from Net Income.
- **Lease Accounting:** Understand the impact of the new lease standards on financial statements.
- **Deferred Taxes:** Conceptual understanding of DTA/DTL creation and changes.
- **Ratio Interpretation:** Don't just calculate; understand what the ratios mean and how they compare.
