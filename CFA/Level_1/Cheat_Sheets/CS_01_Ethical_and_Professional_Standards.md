Members of CFA Institute (including CFA charterholders) and candidates for the CFA designation must:
1.  Act with **integrity, competence, diligence, respect, and in an ethical manner** with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets.
2.  Place the **integrity of the investment profession and the interests of clients above their own personal interests.**
3.  Use **reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgment** when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities.
4.  **Practice and encourage others to practice** in a professional and ethical manner that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession.
5.  **Promote the integrity and viability of the global capital markets** for the ultimate benefit of society.
6.  **Maintain and improve their professional competence** and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals.

    *   Must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another’s independence and objectivity.
    *   *Guidance:* Gifts from clients are less likely to compromise than gifts from entities seeking influence. Distinguish between modest gifts and those of substantial value. Disclose to employer. Travel funding for analysts should be limited.
*   **I(C) Misrepresentation:**

*   **II(A) Material Nonpublic Information:**
    *   Members and Candidates who possess material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.
    *   *Material:* If disclosure of the information would likely have an impact on the price of a security or if reasonable investors would want to know the information before making an investment decision.
    *   *Nonpublic:* Until it has been disseminated to the marketplace in general or can be found in the public domain.
    *   *Mosaic Theory:* Reaching an investment conclusion through analysis of public information and nonmaterial nonpublic information is not a violation.
    *   *Firewall:* Implement procedures to prevent communication of material nonpublic info (e.g., separate departments, restricted lists).

## II. Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) - Overview

*   **Purpose:** To provide a standardized framework for calculating and presenting investment performance that is readily comparable among investment managers. Aims to prevent misleading practices.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Ethical standards for performance presentation.
    *   Firms claim compliance on a firm-wide basis, not for specific products.
    *   Requires use of composites (aggregation of discretionary portfolios with similar strategy/objectives).
    *   Aims to ensure fair representation and full disclosure.
*   **Objectives of GIPS:**
    *   Obtain global acceptance of calculation and presentation standards.
    *   Ensure consistent, accurate investment performance data.
    *   Promote fair competition among investment management firms.
    *   Promote global industry self-regulation.
*   **Who can claim compliance?** Only investment management firms. Plan sponsors and consultants cannot claim compliance unless they manage assets for which they claim compliance.
*   **Composites:** An aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy.
    *   Must include all actual fee-paying, discretionary portfolios in composites.
    *   Non-discretionary portfolios must not be included in composites.
    *   Terminated portfolios must be included in historical performance of composites up to the last full measurement period.
*   **Verification:** Voluntary process performed by an independent third party to confirm a firm's compliance with GIPS on a firm-wide basis.
    *   Verification tests:
        1.  Whether the investment firm has complied with all composite construction requirements of GIPS on a firm-wide basis.
        2.  Whether the firm’s processes and procedures are established to present performance in accordance with GIPS.
*   **GIPS Sections (High-Level):**
    1.  Fundamentals of Compliance (definition of firm, documentation, compliance statement)
    2.  Input Data (consistency of input data)
    3.  Calculation Methodology (total return, time-weighted, day-weighted cash flows)
    4.  Composite Construction (all actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios)
    5.  Disclosure (many specific disclosures required)
    6.  Presentation and Reporting (what must be reported)
    7.  Real Estate (specific provisions)
    8.  Private Equity (specific provisions)
    9.  Wrap Fee/SMA Portfolios (specific provisions)

**Must-Know Learning Outcomes (Illustrative - refer to official LOS):**

*   **Nonpublic Information:** Information that has not been disseminated to the general marketplace.
*   **Misrepresentation:** Untrue statement, omission of fact, or false/misleading statement.
*   **Independence and Objectivity:** Freedom from influences that could compromise professional judgment.

This cheat sheet provides a condensed overview. For full understanding and application, refer to the official CFA Program curriculum. Good luck!You are absolutely correct! I apologize for that oversight. I need to generate the content for the cheat sheets as per the plan.

I will start by creating the first cheat sheet: `CS_01_Ethical_and_Professional_Standards.md` in the `CFA/Level_1/Cheat_Sheets/` directory, with comprehensive content.
