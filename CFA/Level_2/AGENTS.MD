# AGENTS.MD - CFA Level 2 Section

## Inherits From
This document inherits principles from the root `AGENTS.MD` and the `/CFA/AGENTS.MD` file. Please review those first.

## 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_2/` directory is dedicated to providing study materials specifically for the Level II CFA Program exam. Content should align with the official CFA Institute Level II curriculum, focusing on asset valuation and application of concepts.

The `CFA/Level_2/README.md` provides an overview of this section's content and is best viewed via `CFA/Level_2/readme_viewer.html`, which uses the site's standard README presentation.

## 2. Content Structure
Content within this directory should follow the structure outlined in `/CFA/AGENTS.MD` (e.g., `Topic_Deep_Dives/`, `Cheat_Sheets/`, `Practice_Exams/` (item sets), `Case_Studies/`).

## 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 2 Content
*   **Application & Analysis Focus:** Level II content emphasizes applying tools and concepts to asset valuation. Vignette-style (item set) questions are key.
*   **Valuation Depth:** Materials should cover equity, fixed income, derivatives, and alternative investment valuation in detail.
*   **Integration of Concepts:** Show how different topic areas (e.g., FSA and Equity) integrate in valuation scenarios.

Refer to `/CFA/AGENTS.MD` for more detailed guidelines on creating CFA content.
