# Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this directory and its subdirectories.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the overall repository structure, formatting, and writing style. Refer to the main `README.md` and other `AGENTS.MD` files for examples.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Explanations should be clear, especially for complex Level 2 topics. Vignettes for practice exams must be well-written and unambiguous.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Follow standard Markdown syntax.
*   **Accuracy:** All financial concepts, formulas, examples, and curriculum references must be accurate and align with the CFA Institute Level 2 curriculum. This is critical for asset valuation topics.
*   **File Naming:** Use clear and consistent file names (e.g., `L2_Topic_SubTopic.md`, `L2_Practice_Exam_N_Vignette_M.md`). Follow existing naming conventions.
*   **Links:**
    *   Use relative links for internal navigation.
    *   Verify that all links are functional.
*   **Updating Navigation:** When adding new content (e.g., a new deep dive or practice exam item set):
    *   Ensure `CFA/Level_2/README.md` is updated if the new content is significant.
    *   The main `CFA/index.html` (Study Materials Library section and `AppData` in JS) must be updated to include links to the new material.
*   **Review:** Before submitting changes, review your work for adherence to these guidelines and the specific task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: CFA Level 2

### Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from `CFA/AGENTS.MD` (parent directory) and the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
This `/CFA/Level_2/` directory contains study materials specifically for the CFA Program Level 2 exam. Content must focus on asset valuation and the application of investment tools.

The primary README for this level is `CFA/Level_2/README.md`. Navigation to specific materials is also managed by `CFA/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure and Types
Content within this directory is further organized into subdirectories:
*   `Topic_Deep_Dives/`: Detailed explanations of complex valuation models and analytical techniques.
*   `Cheat_Sheets/`: Concise summaries of formulas and key concepts, especially for valuation.
*   `Practice_Exams/`: Item sets (vignettes with 4-6 multiple-choice questions).
*   `Case_Studies/`: Application of concepts to more complex scenarios, often integrating multiple topic areas.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Level 2 Content
*   **LOS Focus:** Clearly reference the relevant Learning Outcome Statement(s) from the Level 2 curriculum.
*   **Application and Valuation Focus:** Level 2 emphasizes applying concepts. Content should reflect this, moving beyond definitions to analysis and valuation.
*   **Item Set Format (for Practice Exams):** Practice questions must be presented in the vignette (mini-case study) format. Each vignette should be followed by 4 or 6 multiple-choice questions.
*   **Complexity:** Level 2 topics are more complex than Level 1. Explanations in deep dives should be thorough but still clear.
*   **Integration:** Highlight how different topic areas integrate (e.g., how FSA impacts equity valuation).
