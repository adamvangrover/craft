# CFA Level II Case Study: Pension Analysis Impact on Valuation

## Scenario: Global Manufacturing Inc. (GMI)

**(Placeholder for a detailed scenario. GMI is a mature company with a significant defined benefit pension plan. The case will provide excerpts from GMI's financial statements, including pension footnotes, and details about actuarial assumptions.)**

**Key Information Provided:**
*   GMI's reported financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet).
*   Pension footnote disclosures:
    *   Funded status of the pension plan (PBO vs. Plan Assets).
    *   Components of periodic pension cost.
    *   Key actuarial assumptions (discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase).
*   Industry comparables for pension assumptions.

## Case Study Questions

This case study requires you to analyze the impact of GMI's pension plan on its financial statements and overall valuation.

1.  **Pension Expense Analysis:**
    *   Calculate GMI's total periodic pension cost (TPPC).
    *   Identify which components of TPPC are reported in Net Income and which are reported in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) under both IFRS and US GAAP (assuming GMI could report under either).
    *   Discuss how a change in the discount rate would affect GMI's reported pension expense.

2.  **Funded Status and Balance Sheet Impact:**
    *   Determine the funded status of GMI's pension plan. Is it overfunded or underfunded?
    *   Explain how the funded status is reflected on GMI's balance sheet under IFRS and US GAAP.

3.  **Impact on Financial Ratios:**
    *   Discuss how GMI's pension plan might affect key financial ratios, such as:
        *   Leverage ratios (e.g., Debt-to-Equity).
        *   Profitability ratios (e.g., ROE).
    *   How might an analyst adjust GMI's reported financials to better reflect the economic substance of its pension obligations?

4.  **Valuation Implications:**
    *   Explain how the pension plan's funded status and expense could impact the valuation of GMI's equity.
    *   If GMI were an acquisition target, how would a potential acquirer likely view the pension obligation?

5.  **Assumption Sensitivity:**
    *   Identify the actuarial assumption that typically has the most significant impact on pension obligations and expense.
    *   Discuss the implications if GMI's expected rate of return on plan assets is significantly higher than that of its peers.
