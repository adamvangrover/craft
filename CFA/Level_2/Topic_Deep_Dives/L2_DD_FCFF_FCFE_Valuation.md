# CFA Level II Deep Dive: Equity - FCFF and FCFE Valuation

## Overview
This deep dive explores the Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) valuation models, critical components of equity analysis at CFA Level II. These models value a company based on the cash flows available to all investors (FCFF) or to equity investors only (FCFE).

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will cover the derivation of FCFF and FCFE from financial statements, forecasting these cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates (WACC for FCFF, cost of equity for FCFE), and applying single-stage and multi-stage growth models.)*

## Key Concepts

*   **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** Cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity holders) after paying all operating expenses (including taxes) and making necessary investments in working capital and fixed capital.
    *   FCFF = Net Income + Net Noncash Charges + Interest Expense*(1-Tax Rate) - Fixed Capital Investment - Working Capital Investment
    *   FCFF = CFO + Interest Expense*(1-Tax Rate) - Fixed Capital Investment
*   **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** Cash flow available to common shareholders after all operating expenses, interest payments, debt repayments, and investments in working and fixed capital have been made.
    *   FCFE = FCFF - Interest Expense*(1-Tax Rate) + Net Borrowing
    *   FCFE = Net Income + Net Noncash Charges - Fixed Capital Investment - Working Capital Investment + Net Borrowing
    *   FCFE = CFO - Fixed Capital Investment + Net Borrowing
*   **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** Discount rate for FCFF.
*   **Cost of Equity (ke):** Discount rate for FCFE.
*   **Terminal Value:** Estimating the value of cash flows beyond the explicit forecast horizon.

## Valuation Models

*   **Single-Stage (Constant Growth) FCFF Model:** V_firm = FCFF1 / (WACC - g)
*   **Single-Stage (Constant Growth) FCFE Model:** V_equity = FCFE1 / (ke - g)
*   **Multi-Stage Models (e.g., two-stage, H-model):** Used when growth is not constant.

## Analytical Considerations

*   Consistency between cash flow definition and discount rate.
*   Forecasting individual components of FCFF/FCFE.
*   Sensitivity analysis to key inputs (growth rates, discount rates).
*   Comparison with other valuation models (e.g., DDM, relative valuation).
