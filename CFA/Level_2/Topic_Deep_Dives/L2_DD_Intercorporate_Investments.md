# CFA Level II Deep Dive: FRA - Intercorporate Investments

## Overview
This deep dive covers the accounting and analysis of intercorporate investments as per IFRS and US GAAP, a key topic in Financial Reporting and Analysis (FRA) at CFA Level II. Understanding how companies account for their investments in other companies is crucial for accurate financial statement analysis and valuation. The main methods depend on the level of influence or control the investor has over the investee.

## 1. Classifications and Accounting Methods

The accounting treatment for intercorporate investments primarily depends on the investor's influence over the investee:

*   **Investments in Financial Assets (Little or no influence):**
    *   Typically applies to ownership stakes less than 20%.
    *   Accounting depends on whether the asset is a debt or equity security and the company's business model/intentions.
    *   **IFRS 9:**
        *   **Amortized Cost:** For debt securities held to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest).
        *   **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI):** For debt securities held to collect contractual cash flows AND sell; OR for equity securities where the company makes an irrevocable election at inception to record G/L in OCI (not recycled to P&L).
        *   **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL):** Default for equity securities (if no FVOCI election), and for debt securities not meeting amortized cost or FVOCI criteria. All derivatives are FVTPL.
    *   **US GAAP (ASC 321 for Equity, ASC 320 for Debt):**
        *   **Equity Securities:** Generally at Fair Value Through Net Income (similar to FVTPL). No FVOCI option for equities (except for non-profit entities or specific non-marketable equities).
        *   **Debt Securities:** Classified as:
            *   **Trading Securities:** Fair Value Through Net Income (FVTNI).
            *   **Available-for-Sale (AFS):** Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), with unrealized G/L in OCI. Realized G/L and impairment are recognized in P&L.
            *   **Held-to-Maturity (HTM):** Amortized cost, if intent and ability to hold to maturity.

*   **Investments in Associates (Significant influence):**
    *   Typically 20% to 50% ownership.
    *   Accounted for using the **Equity Method**.

*   **Business Combinations (Control):**
    *   Typically more than 50% ownership.
    *   Accounted for using the **Acquisition Method**, leading to consolidation.

*   **Joint Ventures (Joint control):**
    *   Parties have joint control by contractual agreement.
    *   **IFRS:** Equity method is required (IFRS 11).
    *   **US GAAP:** Equity method is generally used. Proportionate consolidation is rare.

## 2. Equity Method (Investments in Associates & JVs under IFRS)

*   **Initial Recognition:** Investment is recorded at cost.
*   **Subsequent Measurement:**
    *   The investment account is increased by the investor's proportionate share of the investee's net income.
    *   The investment account is decreased by the investor's proportionate share of the investee's net loss.
    *   Dividends received from the investee reduce the investment account (as they are a return of capital from the investor's perspective, the earnings having already been recognized).
    *   The investor's share of the investee's Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) is recognized in the investor's OCI.

**Example (Equity Method):**
Company A buys 30% of Company B for $300,000.
Year 1: Company B reports Net Income of $50,000 and pays dividends of $20,000.
*   Company A's share of Net Income = 30% * $50,000 = $15,000. (Recognized in Company A's P&L)
*   Company A's share of Dividends = 30% * $20,000 = $6,000.
*   Investment in Company B account (end of Year 1) = $300,000 (initial) + $15,000 (income) - $6,000 (dividends) = $309,000.

**Amortization of Excess Purchase Price:**
If the purchase price > book value of net assets acquired, the excess may be attributable to specific identifiable assets (e.g., undervalued PP&E) or goodwill. The portion attributable to depreciable/amortizable assets should be amortized over their useful lives, reducing the equity income recognized by the investor.

## 3. Acquisition Method (Business Combinations)

When an investor gains control over an investee, it's a business combination.
*   **Measurement Principle:** All identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (NCI) in the acquiree are measured at their **fair values** at the acquisition date.
*   **Goodwill:**
    ```
    Goodwill = Consideration Transferred (Purchase Price) - Fair Value of Net Identifiable Assets Acquired
    ```
    Net Identifiable Assets = Fair Value of Assets - Fair Value of Liabilities.
    If consideration is less than the fair value of net identifiable assets (a "bargain purchase"), the acquirer recognizes a gain in its P&L on the acquisition date.
*   **Noncontrolling Interest (NCI):** The portion of the subsidiary's equity not owned by the parent.
    *   **IFRS:** NCI can be measured at fair value OR at NCI's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets.
    *   **US GAAP:** NCI must be measured at fair value.
*   **Consolidation:** The parent company prepares consolidated financial statements that combine 100% of the subsidiary's assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, even if it owns less than 100%. The NCI's share of the subsidiary's net income and equity is then backed out.
    *   **Intercompany Transactions:** Must be eliminated in full upon consolidation (e.g., sales between parent and sub, upstream/downstream profits in inventory).

## 4. Financial Statement Analysis Implications

### Impact of Equity Method:
*   **Balance Sheet:** Investment account shown as a single line item. Investee's individual assets/liabilities are not on the investor's balance sheet.
*   **Income Statement:** Investor's share of investee's net income shown as a single line item.
*   **Ratio Distortion:**
    *   **Leverage Ratios (e.g., Debt-to-Equity, Debt-to-Assets):** May appear lower for the investor because the investee's debt is not on the investor's balance sheet.
    *   **Profitability Ratios (e.g., Net Profit Margin):** Can be affected as equity income is included in net income, but the sales that generated that income are not.
    *   **Turnover Ratios (e.g., Asset Turnover):** May be higher as the investment account is typically smaller than the underlying assets of the investee.
*   **Analyst Adjustments:**
    *   **Proportionate Consolidation (Analytical):** Add the investor's share of the investee's assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses to the investor's statements. This can provide a more economically realistic view.
    *   **Exclusion:** Remove the investment account and equity income for certain ratio calculations to analyze the investor's core operations.

### Impact of Acquisition Method (Consolidation):
*   **Goodwill:** A significant asset on the balance sheet. Subject to annual impairment testing (not amortization). Impairment charges can significantly impact net income.
*   **Noncontrolling Interest:** Presents challenges in analyzing consolidated equity and net income. Net income attributable to NCI is subtracted to arrive at net income attributable to parent shareholders.
*   **Comparability Issues:** Post-acquisition, the consolidated entity is different from the pre-acquisition parent. Analyzing trends requires care.

### Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) / Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
*   Entities created for a specific purpose (e.g., securitization).
*   **US GAAP (VIEs):** An entity is a VIE if it has insufficient equity at risk OR its equity holders lack decision-making rights or rights to residual profits/losses. The primary beneficiary of a VIE must consolidate it.
*   **IFRS (IFRS 10):** Focuses on the concept of "control" to determine consolidation, which includes power over the investee, exposure to variable returns, and the ability to use power to affect those returns.
*   Analysts must scrutinize whether companies are using unconsolidated SPEs/VIEs to keep debt or risk off the balance sheet.

## 5. Impairment

*   **Investments accounted for at Amortized Cost or FVOCI (Debt):** Assessed for impairment based on expected credit losses.
*   **Equity Method Investments:** If the fair value of the investment falls below its carrying amount and the decline is considered other-than-temporary (US GAAP) or there's objective evidence of impairment (IFRS), an impairment loss is recognized.
*   **Goodwill (from Business Combinations):**
    *   **US GAAP:** Tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, at least annually. If carrying amount of reporting unit > fair value, an impairment loss is recognized (limited to the amount of goodwill).
    *   **IFRS:** Tested for impairment at the cash-generating unit (CGU) level, at least annually. If recoverable amount of CGU < carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized (first allocated to goodwill, then to other assets).
