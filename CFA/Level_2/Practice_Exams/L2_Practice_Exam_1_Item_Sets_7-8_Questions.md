## Item Set 7: Alternative Investments - Real Estate & Private Equity (Questions 37-42)

The following information pertains to Questions 37–42.

Maria Sanchez, CFA, is an analyst evaluating two alternative investment opportunities: a direct real estate investment and a private equity fund.

**Real Estate Investment: Office Property**
*   Projected Year 1 Net Operating Income (NOI): $500,000
*   Market Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate) for similar properties: 8.0%
*   Discount Rate (Required Return) for this property: 10.0%
*   Expected constant growth rate of NOI and Value (g): 3.0%
*   The property has recurring maintenance-type capital expenditures estimated at $50,000 per year, not included in NOI calculation. Non-cash rents are negligible.

**Private Equity Fund: "Growth Ventures LP"**
Growth Ventures LP is a new venture capital fund. Sanchez reviews its terms:
*   Management Fee: 2% of committed capital annually.
*   Incentive Fee (Carried Interest): 20% of profits.
*   Hurdle Rate: 8% per annum (soft hurdle).
*   GP Catch-up: 100% (meaning GP receives 100% of distributions after LP receives hurdle rate until GP's catch-up share of profits is reached).
*   Committed Capital: $100 million.
In Year 1, the fund called 30% of committed capital. The fund generated a gross return of 15% on called capital before management fees. Assume management fees are based on committed capital and calculated at year-end.

**Question 37:**
Using the direct capitalization method, the estimated value of the office property is *closest* to:
A) $5,000,000
B) $6,250,000
C) $7,142,857

**Question 38:**
If Sanchez were to value the office property using a constant growth DCF model (Gordon Growth model applied to NOI), the value would be *closest* to:
A) $6,250,000
B) $7,142,857
C) $7,357,143

**Question 39:**
An investor is considering purchasing shares in a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Which of the following metrics would be *most* appropriate for valuing the REIT's shares, analogous to earnings per share for a common stock?
A) Net Operating Income (NOI) per share.
B) Funds From Operations (FFO) per share.
C) Net Asset Value (NAV) per share.

**Question 40:**
For the Growth Ventures LP fund, the management fee charged for Year 1 is *closest* to:
A) $600,000
B) $2,000,000
C) $3,000,000

**Question 41:**
For Growth Ventures LP in Year 1, assuming the gross profit on called capital is calculated *before* management fees, the profit available for incentive fee calculation (after hurdle) is *closest* to:
(Called Capital = $30M, Gross Return = 15% on called capital, Management Fee from Q40, Hurdle Rate = 8% on called capital)
A) $300,000
B) $600,000
C) $2,100,000

**Question 42:**
Which of the following best describes a common characteristic of LBO (Leveraged Buyout) fund investments?
A) Primary reliance on early-stage company growth for returns.
B) Significant use of debt to finance the acquisition of mature companies.
C) Short investment horizons, typically less than 2 years.

## Item Set 8: Portfolio Management - Risk & Active Management (Questions 43-48)

The following information pertains to Questions 43–48.

John Carter, CFA, manages an active equity portfolio. The portfolio and its benchmark have the following characteristics:

*   Portfolio Expected Return (Rp): 12.0%
*   Benchmark Expected Return (Rb): 10.0%
*   Portfolio Beta (βp): 1.10
*   Benchmark Beta (βb): 1.00
*   Portfolio Standard Deviation (σp): 18.0%
*   Benchmark Standard Deviation (σb): 15.0%
*   Risk-Free Rate (Rf): 3.0%
*   Tracking Error (Active Risk, σ(Rp-Rb)): 5.0%

Carter is also evaluating a multifactor model to explain stock returns:
`E(Ri) = Rf + βi,mkt * MRP + βi,size * SMB + βi,value * HML`
Where MRP = Market Risk Premium, SMB = Small Minus Big factor premium, HML = High Minus Low (Value) factor premium.

A stock analyst provides Carter with the following information for Stock X:
*   β_mkt = 1.2
*   β_size = -0.3 (negative exposure to small-cap factor)
*   β_value = 0.5 (positive exposure to value factor)
*   MRP = 6.0%, SMB factor premium = 2.0%, HML factor premium = 3.0%
*   Stock X's actual expected return (analyst forecast) = 11.5%

**Question 43:**
The Sharpe Ratio for Carter's active portfolio is *closest* to:
A) 0.500
B) 0.556
C) 0.611

**Question 44:**
The Information Ratio (IR) for Carter's active portfolio is *closest* to:
A) 0.20
B) 0.40
C) 0.60

**Question 45:**
According to the fundamental law of active management, if Carter maintains an Information Coefficient (IC) of 0.10, the implied Breadth (BR) of his investment strategy is *closest* to:
A) 4
B) 16
C) 25

**Question 46:**
Using the given multifactor model and factor premiums, the required return for Stock X is *closest* to:
A) 9.1%
B) 11.1%
C) 12.1%

**Question 47:**
Based on the analyst's actual expected return for Stock X (11.5%) and its required return from the multifactor model (calculated in Q46), Stock X appears to be:
A) Undervalued.
B) Fairly valued.
C) Overvalued.

**Question 48:**
A portfolio manager wants to reduce the market risk exposure of an equity portfolio currently valued at $50 million with a beta of 1.2. The manager decides to use stock index futures to hedge. The stock index futures contract has a beta of 1.0, a current price of $250,000 per contract (multiplier included). To reduce the portfolio beta to 0.8, the manager should:
A) Sell 40 futures contracts.
B) Buy 40 futures contracts.
C) Sell 80 futures contracts.
