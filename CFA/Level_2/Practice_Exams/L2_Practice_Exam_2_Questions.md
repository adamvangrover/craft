# CFA Level 2 Practice Exam 2: Questions

## Item Set 1: Ethical and Professional Standards (Questions 1-4)

Maria Petrova, CFA, is a portfolio manager at Alpha Investments. Alpha's compliance manual requires pre-clearance for all personal trades in securities that Alpha also trades for clients. Petrova manages a balanced fund that includes common stock of Zenith Corp.

Petrova is considering purchasing Zenith Corp. shares for her personal account. She believes Zenith is undervalued and has strong long-term prospects. Before making any trade, she submits a pre-clearance request as per Alpha's policy. The request is approved by the compliance officer, David Lee, CFA, who notes that Alpha has not traded Zenith for any client accounts in the past week and has no pending client orders for Zenith.

A week after Petrova purchases Zenith shares for her personal account, one of her major institutional clients, the National Pension Fund (NPF), expresses interest in increasing its exposure to the technology sector, and specifically mentions Zenith Corp. as a company they have been reviewing favorably. Petrova, aware of her personal holding, informs Lee about NPF's interest. Lee advises that as long as NPF's potential order is handled according to Alpha's trade allocation policies, there should be no issue. Petrova subsequently recommends a significant purchase of Zenith Corp. for NPF's portfolio, which is then executed. The NPF trade is substantially larger than Petrova's personal trade and occurs at a slightly higher price than Petrova's personal purchase price.

Later, Petrova is approached by a new software company, Innovatech, seeking venture capital. Innovatech offers Petrova a significant allocation of founder's shares at a nominal price if she helps them connect with potential investors among her contacts. Petrova believes Innovatech has a promising product. She mentions this opportunity to a few wealthy individual clients who she knows are interested in early-stage investments, clearly stating her potential benefit (the founder's shares) if they invest. She does not mention this to her employer, Alpha Investments, as she considers this a personal networking activity outside her role at Alpha.

**Question 1:**
Did Petrova's personal trade in Zenith Corp. shares *most likely* violate any CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct?
A) Yes, because she traded in a security that her client later purchased.
B) No, because she obtained pre-clearance and her trade did not disadvantage any client.
C) Yes, because she should not personally trade in securities recommended to clients.

**Question 2:**
Regarding the recommendation and subsequent trade of Zenith Corp. for the National Pension Fund (NPF), Petrova's actions were:
A) Appropriate, as client interests were prioritized and disclosures were made to compliance.
B) Inappropriate, because she had a personal holding in the security.
C) Inappropriate, unless she sold her personal holdings before recommending the security to NPF.

**Question 3:**
Petrova's handling of the Innovatech venture capital opportunity was *most likely* a violation of which CFA Institute Standard of Professional Conduct?
A) Standard IV(A) Loyalty.
B) Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts.
C) Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality.

**Question 4:**
David Lee's, CFA, advice regarding NPF's potential order in Zenith Corp. was *most likely*:
A) Appropriate, as long as trade allocation policies are fair.
B) Inappropriate, as he should have prohibited Petrova from recommending Zenith due to her personal holding.
C) Inappropriate, as he has a supervisory responsibility to prevent potential conflicts from materializing.

## Item Set 2: Equity Valuation (Questions 5-8)

Global Conglomerate Inc. (GCI) is a mature company operating in various industries. An analyst, Sarah Chen, CFA, is evaluating GCI's stock. GCI recently paid an annual dividend of $2.00 per share. Chen expects dividends to grow at 8% for the next two years, then at 5% for the following three years, after which the growth rate will stabilize at 3% indefinitely. GCI's required rate of return on equity (ke) is 10%.

GCI's most recent reported EPS was $3.50. The company maintains a target payout ratio of 60%. The current book value per share is $25.00, and Chen expects the long-term return on equity (ROE) to be 12%.

Chen is also considering a Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) valuation. For the most recent year, GCI reported:
*   Net Income = $500 million
*   Depreciation = $150 million
*   Capital Expenditures = $200 million
*   Change in Net Working Capital = $50 million

## Item Set 3: Financial Reporting and Analysis (Questions 9-12)
