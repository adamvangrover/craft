# CFA Level 2 Sample Practice Exam 1: Item Sets 4-6 - Questions

## Item Set 4: Fixed Income - Binomial Tree Valuation (Questions 19-24)

The following information pertains to Questions 19–24.

An analyst is valuing a 2-year, option-free bond with a 5% annual coupon and a par value of $100. The current 1-year spot rate (i_0) is 3.0%. The analyst uses a binomial interest rate tree with an assumed annual interest rate volatility (σ) of 15%. The up-move factor (u) is `e^σ` and the down-move factor (d) is `e^-σ`. Risk-neutral probability for an up-move is 0.5.

The interest rate tree for the 1-year rate is partially constructed as follows:

*   Time 0: `i_0 = 3.000%`
*   Time 1 (Up-node): `i_1,u = i_0 * e^σ`
*   Time 1 (Down-node): `i_1,d = i_0 * e^-σ`

`e^0.15 ≈ 1.161834`
`e^-0.15 ≈ 0.860708`

The tree must be calibrated to correctly price a 1-year benchmark zero-coupon bond (Price = $97.0874) and a 2-year benchmark 4% annual coupon bond (Price = $98.1530). Assume the provided `i_0 = 3.000%` is correct after calibrating the 1-year zero.

**Question 19:**
The 1-year interest rate at Time 1 in the up-state (i_1,u) is *closest* to:
A) 3.000%
B) 3.485%
C) 2.582%

**Question 20:**
The 1-year interest rate at Time 1 in the down-state (i_1,d) is *closest* to:
A) 3.000%
B) 3.485%
C) 2.582%

**Question 21:**
To calibrate the tree for Year 2, the analyst needs to ensure the model value of the 2-year 4% benchmark bond matches its market price ($98.1530). The value of this benchmark bond at Time 1 in the up-state (V_1,u), just after receiving any coupon, is *closest* to:
A) $98.50
B) $100.49
C) $101.37

**Question 22:**
The value of the 2-year 5% annual coupon bond (the bond being valued) at Time 1 in the up-state (V_1,u), just after receiving any coupon, using the rates from the calibrated tree (assume i_1,u = 3.485% and i_1,d = 2.582% for this calculation if not derived previously), is *closest* to:
A) $100.00
B) $101.46
C) $102.34

**Question 23:**
The arbitrage-free value of the 2-year 5% annual coupon bond at Time 0 (V_0) is *closest* to:
A) $98.15
B) $101.89
C) $103.77

**Question 24:**
If the 2-year 5% bond was callable at $101.00 at Time 1, its arbitrage-free value at Time 0 (V_0,callable) would be *closest* to:
A) $101.00
B) $101.64
C) $101.89

## Item Set 5: Economics - Currency Exchange Rates (Questions 25-30)

The following information pertains to Questions 25–30.

An analyst is evaluating the exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR). The current spot exchange rate S(USD/EUR) is 1.2000.

**Economic Data:**

| Country       | Expected Annual Inflation | Nominal Annual Interest Rate (1-year) |
| :------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| United States | 2.0%                      | 1.5%                                  |
| Eurozone      | 1.0%                      | 0.5%                                  |

The analyst assumes that interest rate parity holds for forward rates.

**Question 25:**
According to Relative Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the expected spot exchange rate S(USD/EUR) one year from now is *closest* to:
A) 1.1881
B) 1.2000
C) 1.2119

**Question 26:**
The 1-year forward exchange rate F(USD/EUR), assuming interest rate parity, is *closest* to:
A) 1.1882
B) 1.2000
C) 1.2118

**Question 27:**
If the actual spot exchange rate S(USD/EUR) in one year is 1.2200, an uncovered interest rate parity strategy of borrowing EUR, converting to USD, investing in USD, and converting back to EUR would have resulted in an arbitrage profit if the forward rate from Question 26 was used for hedging. Comparing the actual spot rate to the expected spot rate implied by uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP), which currency performed better than UIRP predicted?
A) USD performed better.
B) EUR performed better.
C) Both performed as predicted by UIRP.

**Question 28:**
Consider the Mundell-Fleming model with high capital mobility and a floating exchange rate regime. If the Eurozone unexpectedly implements an expansionary monetary policy, the EUR will *most likely*:
A) Appreciate against the USD due to higher expected growth.
B) Depreciate against the USD due to lower Eurozone interest rates.
C) Remain unchanged as capital flows will offset the monetary policy impact.

**Question 29:**
An analyst observes that the real exchange rate RX(USD/EUR) has been consistently increasing over the past 5 years. This *most likely* indicates that:
A) US goods have become relatively cheaper compared to Eurozone goods.
B) Eurozone goods have become relatively cheaper compared to US goods.
C) PPP has held perfectly over the period.

**Question 30:**
If the US experiences a surge in domestic investment opportunities leading to increased capital inflows, under a floating exchange rate system and high capital mobility, the USD would *most likely*:
A) Depreciate due to higher demand for foreign capital goods.
B) Appreciate due to higher demand for USD to invest.
C) Remain stable as the current account adjusts.
