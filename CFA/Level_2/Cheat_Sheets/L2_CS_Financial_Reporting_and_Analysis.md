# CFA Level II Cheat Sheet: Financial Reporting and Analysis (FRA)

## Overview
This cheat sheet summarizes key concepts for Financial Reporting and Analysis (FRA) at CFA Level II. Level II FRA focuses on more complex accounting topics like intercorporate investments, employee compensation (pensions and stock options), and multinational operations.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will cover key accounting treatments and analytical considerations for these advanced FRA topics.)*

## Key Topics & Formulas

### 1. Intercorporate Investments
*   **Investments in Financial Assets (IFRS 9 / ASC 321):**
    *   Amortized Cost (debt instruments held to collect contractual cash flows).
    *   Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) (debt & equity).
    *   Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) (debt & equity).
*   **Investments in Associates (Equity Method):** Significant influence (typically 20-50% ownership).
    *   Initial investment at cost.
    *   Pro-rata share of investee's net income increases investment account. Dividends decrease it.
*   **Business Combinations (Acquisition Method):** Control (>50% ownership).
    *   Goodwill = Purchase Price - Fair Value of Net Identifiable Assets.
    *   Consolidation: Combine 100% of subsidiary's assets & liabilities. Noncontrolling interest shown in equity.

### 2. Employee Compensation: Post-Employment and Share-Based
*   **Defined Benefit Pensions:**
    *   Funded Status = Fair Value of Plan Assets - PBO (Projected Benefit Obligation).
    *   Total Periodic Pension Cost (TPPC) = Current Service Cost + Past Service Cost + Interest Cost - Actual Return on Plan Assets +/- Actuarial Gains/Losses.
    *   Components of TPPC reported in P&L vs. OCI vary by IFRS/GAAP.
*   **Share-Based Compensation (Stock Options, Restricted Stock):**
    *   Recognize compensation expense over the vesting period based on fair value at grant date.
    *   Impact on EPS (diluted EPS using treasury stock method).

### 3. Multinational Operations (Foreign Currency Translation)
*   **Functional Currency:** Currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
*   **Presentation (Reporting) Currency:** Currency in which the parent company prepares its financial statements.
*   **Translation Methods:**
    *   **Current Rate Method:** Used when functional currency is the local currency.
        *   Assets/Liabilities: Translated at current (year-end) exchange rate.
        *   Equity: Translated at historical rates (except retained earnings).
        *   Income Statement: Translated at average exchange rate.
        *   Translation gain/loss reported in OCI (CTA - Cumulative Translation Adjustment).
    *   **Temporal (Remeasurement) Method:** Used when functional currency is the parent's presentation currency.
        *   Monetary Assets/Liabilities: Translated at current rate.
        *   Non-monetary Assets/Liabilities: Translated at historical rates.
        *   Income Statement items related to historical cost assets (e.g. COGS, Depreciation): Translated at historical rates. Other items at average rate.
        *   Remeasurement gain/loss reported in Net Income.

### 4. Analysis of Financial Institutions (Brief Overview)
*   Key considerations: Capital adequacy (e.g., CET1 ratio), asset quality, liquidity, earnings.
*   Basel III framework.
