# CFA Level II Cheat Sheet: Quantitative Methods

## Overview
This cheat sheet summarizes key concepts and formulas for Quantitative Methods at CFA Level II. Level II Quants often focus on applications of regression, time series analysis, and simulations.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will cover key formulas and concepts for correlation and regression, multiple regression, time-series analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation.)*

## Key Topics & Formulas

### 1. Correlation and Regression
*   **Linear Regression:** Y = b0 + b1X + ε
*   **Standard Error of Estimate (SEE):** Measures the degree of variability of the actual Y-values relative to the estimated Y-values.
*   **Coefficient of Determination (R²):** Percentage of variation in Y explained by X.
*   **Hypothesis Testing for Regression Coefficients:** t-statistic = (Estimated Coefficient - Hypothesized Value) / Standard Error of Coefficient

### 2. Multiple Regression
*   **Assumptions:** Linearity, homoskedasticity, independence of errors, normality of errors.
*   **Adjusted R²:** Adjusts R² for the number of independent variables.
*   **F-statistic:** Tests overall significance of the regression model.
*   **Dummy Variables:** Used for categorical independent variables.
*   **Multicollinearity:** High correlation between independent variables.
*   **Model Misspecification:** Omitting variables, incorrect functional form.

### 3. Time-Series Analysis
*   **Trend Models:** Linear trend, log-linear trend.
*   **Autoregressive (AR) Models:** AR(p) - Yt = b0 + b1*Y(t-1) + ... + bp*Y(t-p) + εt
*   **Mean Reversion:** Check if b1 in AR(1) is less than 1.
*   **Seasonality:** Detected by significant autocorrelation at seasonal lags.
*   **Unit Roots & Nonstationarity:** Dickey-Fuller test. First differencing for correction.
*   **ARCH Models:** Used when variance of errors is not constant.

### 4. Monte Carlo Simulation
*   Steps: Specify quantities of interest, define distributions for inputs, generate random values, calculate results, analyze distribution of results.
*   Uses: Valuing complex derivatives, risk analysis.
