## II. CFA Institute Research Objectivity Standards (ROS)
- While not directly tested as a separate topic like the Code & Standards, awareness is useful, especially for analysts.
- Focuses on managing conflicts in the preparation and distribution of investment research.
- Key areas: public appearance policies, rating systems, research review, personal trading by analysts.

- A set of ethical principles for standardized, industry-wide calculation and presentation of investment performance.
- **Objectives:** Ensure fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance. Promote comparability.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Firm-wide compliance is required.
    - Input data integrity is crucial.
    - Calculation methodology requirements.

- *L2 Nuance:* Understanding composite construction requirements, verification process, specific disclosure items. Why firms comply with GIPS.

## Application Scenarios - Common L2 Themes:
- **Portfolio Management Context:** Applying Standards to suitability, fair dealing in trade allocation, performance presentation (GIPS), disclosure of conflicts related to fee structures or soft dollars.
- **Research Analyst Context:** Diligence in using models, MNPI and mosaic theory, independence and objectivity when pressured by issuers or corporate finance side of the firm, disclosure of conflicts.

2.  *What is my duty in this situation?* (Loyalty, Prudence, Care, Fair Dealing etc.)
3.  *Are there any conflicts of interest? Have they been adequately disclosed?*
4.  *Is this information material and nonpublic?*
5.  *Do I have a reasonable basis for my analysis/recommendation?*
6.  *How would this action be perceived by clients/public/regulators?*

*Always prioritize the interests of clients and the integrity of capital markets.*
