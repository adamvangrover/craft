# Financial Knowledge Base Model Card

## Dataset Description
This dataset contains a comprehensive knowledge base derived from the Financial Learning Hub repository. It is designed to facilitate the training, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for AI models specializing in credit analysis, financial modeling, and legal documentation review.

## Artifacts

### 1. Text Corpus (`knowledge_base.jsonl`)
- **Format:** JSONL (JSON Lines)
- **Content:** Chunked text extracted from Markdown, JSON, and text files across the repository.
- **Structure:**
  - `id`: Unique hash of the chunk.
  - `source`: Filepath of the source document.
  - `breadcrumbs`: Hierarchical context (headers).
  - `content`: The actual text content.
  - `type`: Content type (text, definition, perspective, tip, data).

### 2. Knowledge Graph (`knowledge_graph.json`)
- **Format:** JSON (Nodes and Edges)
- **Content:** A semantic graph connecting files, chunks, and key concepts.
- **Nodes:**
  - `File`: Source documents.
  - `Chunk`: Text segments.
  - `Concept`: Key financial terms extracted from the glossary.
- **Edges:**
  - `CONTAINS`: File -> Chunk
  - `MENTIONS`: Chunk -> Concept

### 3. Decision Trees (`decision_trees.json`)
- **Format:** JSON
- **Content:** Structured decision logic extracted from checklists and regulatory frameworks.
- **Use Case:** Can be used to drive logic-based agents or verify process adherence.

### 4. Ontology (`ontology.ttl`)
- **Format:** Turtle (RDF)
- **Content:** Formal definition of the classes and properties used in the knowledge graph.

### 5. Neo4j Import (`import.cypher`)
- **Format:** Cypher Query Language
- **Content:** Scripts to load the Knowledge Graph nodes and edges into a Neo4j database.

## Intended Use
- **RAG Systems:** Use `knowledge_base.jsonl` to build a vector database for question answering.
- **GraphRAG:** Combine vector search with `knowledge_graph.json` for structured retrieval.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Use `decision_trees.json` to guide agents through complex analytical tasks.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Use the structured chunks to fine-tune LLMs on domain-specific financial knowledge.

## Maintenance
This knowledge base is auto-generated by `comprehensive_knowledge_base/build_kb.py` and should be rebuilt whenever the repository content is significantly updated.
