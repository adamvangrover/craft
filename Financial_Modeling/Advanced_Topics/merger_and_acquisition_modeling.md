# Advanced Topic: Merger & Acquisition (M&A) Modeling

## 1. Introduction to M&A Modeling

M&A modeling is a critical tool used to evaluate the financial implications of a merger or acquisition. The primary goal is to determine the potential impact on the acquirer's earnings per share (EPS), a concept known as accretion/dilution analysis.

### Key Objectives of an M&A Model:
*   **Assess Financial Impact:** Understand how the transaction will affect the combined company's financial statements.
*   **Determine Valuation:** Analyze the fairness of the purchase price.
*   **Identify Synergies:** Quantify the potential cost savings and revenue enhancements.
*   **Test Financing Structures:** Evaluate the impact of different financing options (cash, debt, stock).

## 2. Building an M&A Model: Key Steps

### a. Standalone Projections
*   Project the income statements of both the acquirer and the target on a standalone basis for 3-5 years.

### b. Transaction Assumptions
*   **Purchase Price:** The total amount the acquirer will pay for the target.
*   **Financing:** The mix of cash, debt, and stock used to finance the transaction.
*   **Synergies:** The estimated cost and revenue synergies.

### c. Pro Forma Combined Financials
*   Combine the income statements of the acquirer and target.
*   Make adjustments for the transaction, including:
    *   Additional interest expense from new debt.
    *   Goodwill and other intangible assets created in the transaction.
    *   The impact of synergies.

## 3. Accretion/Dilution Analysis

Accretion/dilution analysis is the core output of an M&A model. It measures the impact of the transaction on the acquirer's EPS.

*   **Accretive Transaction:** The pro forma EPS is higher than the acquirer's standalone EPS.
*   **Dilutive Transaction:** The pro forma EPS is lower than the acquirer's standalone EPS.

### Key Drivers of Accretion/Dilution:
*   **Valuation:** The purchase price paid for the target.
*   **Financing:** The cost of financing the transaction.
*   **Synergies:** The amount of synergies realized.

## 4. Example: Accretion/Dilution Calculation

| Description | Acquirer | Target | Pro Forma |
|---|---|---|---|
| Net Income | $100 | $50 | $165 |
| Shares Outstanding | 100 | 25 | 125 |
| **EPS** | **$1.00** | **$2.00** | **$1.32** |

In this example, the transaction is **accretive** because the pro forma EPS of $1.32 is higher than the acquirer's standalone EPS of $1.00.
