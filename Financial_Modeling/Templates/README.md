# Financial Modeling: Templates & Structural Guides

## Overview

This section of the Financial Modeling hub provides structural templates and guides for common financial models. These are not necessarily fully built-out, ready-to-use Excel files, but rather detailed descriptions of how these models are typically structured, the key components, and how they interconnect.

## Purpose of this Section

The primary goals of this section are to:

*   Illustrate the standard architecture of frequently used financial models (e.g., 3-statement model, DCF model, LBO model).
*   Provide a clear understanding of the key worksheets/sections within these models and their purpose.
*   Describe how financial statements and supporting schedules are linked.
*   Offer guidance on setting up models in a way that aligns with best practices for clarity, flexibility, and auditability.
*   Serve as a blueprint for analysts building these models from scratch.

## Contents & Materials

This section currently includes guides on:

*   **[Basic 3-Statement Model Structure](./Basic_3_Statement_Model_Structure.md):** Describes the layout and interconnections of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement, along with key supporting schedules like Debt, PP&E, and Working Capital.
*   **[Excel Financial Model Best Practices](./Excel_Financial_Model_Best_Practices.md):** While broader best practices are covered elsewhere, this document focuses on tips and conventions specifically for implementing models in Microsoft Excel (e.g., formatting, useful functions, structuring for clarity in a spreadsheet environment).

*(Future additions may include structural guides for DCF models, LBO models, M&A models, etc.)*

## How to Use This Section (Student & Teacher Notes)

**For Students & Aspiring Analysts:**

*   **Blueprint for Building:** Use these guides as a reference when constructing your own models.
*   **Understand the "Why":** Focus on why models are structured in a particular way (e.g., why separate supporting schedules? Why link statements in a specific order?).
*   **Adapt, Don't Just Copy:** These are structural guides. You'll need to adapt them to the specific company or situation you are modeling.
*   **Combine with Best Practices:** Always use these structural templates in conjunction with the general [Financial Modeling Best Practices](../Best_Practices/FM_Best_Practices.md).

**For Teachers & Instructors:**

*   **Teaching Aids:** Use these documents to visually and descriptively explain model architecture to students.
*   **Assignment Foundation:** Task students with building a model for a hypothetical company using one of these structural guides as a starting point.
*   **Focus on Linkages:** Emphasize how different parts of the model (statements, schedules) connect and flow into each other.

## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **More Template Guides:** The most obvious area for expansion is adding structural guides for other common model types:
    *   Detailed DCF Model Template (Inputs, Projections, WACC, Valuation summary).
    *   LBO Model Template (Sources & Uses, Debt Tranches, Pro-forma BS, IRR calculation).
    *   M&A Model Template (Accretion/Dilution, Pro-forma combination).
*   **Visual Descriptions:** Enhance existing and future guides with more detailed textual descriptions of sheet layouts, perhaps using Markdown tables to simulate spreadsheet rows/columns for key sections.
*   **Agent Note on Excel Files:** As AI agents primarily create text, actual `.xlsx` template files would typically be added by human contributors. These Markdown guides serve to describe what those Excel files *should* look like or how to build them.

## Possible Avenues for Exploration and Further Development

*   **"Model Shells" in Code:** For more advanced users, conceptual outlines of how these model structures could be initiated programmatically (e.g., Python scripts to set up basic P&L/BS/CFS structures in a CSV or dataframe).
*   **Templates for Specific Analyses:** E.g., a template for a financial ratio analysis dashboard.
*   **Comparison of Template Structures:** Discussing variations in how certain models might be structured by different firms or for different purposes.

These templates and structural guides aim to provide a solid foundation for building robust and well-organized financial models.
