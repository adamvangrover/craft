# Comprehensive Guide to Building a Basic 3-Statement Financial Model

## Introduction

A [3-statement financial model](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#3-statement-model) is the cornerstone of most financial analyses. It links the [Income Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#income-statement-profit--loss-or-pl), [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet), and [Cash Flow Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#statement-of-cash-flows) into a dynamic tool that [forecasts](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#forecastprojection-period) a company's financial performance and position. For [credit analysts](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis), a robust 3-statement model is essential for assessing [repayment capacity](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capacity-five-cs-of-credit), running [sensitivity analyses](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#sensitivity-analysis), and understanding a company's financial trajectory.

This guide provides a detailed structure, key line items, common [forecasting](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#forecastprojection-period) methodologies, and crucial linkages for building a basic but comprehensive 3-statement model.

**Target Audience:** Financial analysts, [credit analysts](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis), students of finance.
**Objective:** To provide a clear blueprint for constructing an integrated [3-statement model](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#3-statement-model).

## I. Model Structure and Best Practices

Before diving into the statements, refer to the **[Excel Financial Model Best Practices](./Excel_Financial_Model_Best_Practices.md)** guide for essential tips on formatting, [assumption](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assumption) management, and error checking. A well-structured model is easier to build, audit, and understand.

**General Layout:**

*   **Inputs/Assumptions Sheet:** Centralize all key drivers and [assumptions](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assumption) (e.g., growth rates, margins, [interest rates](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk), [tax rates](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#effective-tax-rate)).
*   **Historical Financials Sheet (Optional but Recommended):** Input 3-5 years of historical data from company filings.
*   **[Income Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#income-statement-profit--loss-or-pl) Sheet.**
*   **[Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) Sheet.**
*   **[Cash Flow Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#statement-of-cash-flows) Sheet.**
*   **[Supporting Schedules Sheet(s)](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#supporting-schedules-financial-modeling):** For complex items like:
    *   [Debt Schedule](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) (Short-term, Long-term, [Revolver](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#revolving-credit-facility-revolver))
    *   [Fixed Asset Schedule](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capital-expenditures-capex) ([PP&E](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capital-expenditures-capex) Roll-forward)
    *   [Working Capital Schedule](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#working-capital) ([AR](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#accounts-receivable-ar), [Inventory](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#inventory), [AP](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#accounts-payable-ap), etc.)
    *   [Equity Schedule](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity) ([Common Stock](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#common-stock--apic), [Retained Earnings](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#retained-earnings), Other Equity)
    *   (Optional) Revenue Build-up, COGS Build-up, Operating Expense Build-up.

## V. Key Linkages ("Balancing the Model")

Ensuring the statements are correctly linked is critical:

1.  **[Net Income](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#net-income) ([Income Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#income-statement-profit--loss-or-pl))**
    *   Flows into **[Retained Earnings](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#retained-earnings)** on the [Equity](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity) section of the [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) (`Prior RE + NI - Dividends = Current RE`).
    *   Is the starting point for **[Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo)** (indirect method).
2.  **[Depreciation & Amortization](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#depreciation--amortization-da) ([Income Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#income-statement-profit--loss-or-pl) & Supporting Schedules)**
    *   Reduces **Net [PP&E](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#ppe-property-plant--equipment-net)** and **Net [Intangible Assets](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#intangible-assets)** on the [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet).
    *   Is added back to [Net Income](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#net-income) in **[CFO](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo)** (as it's a non-cash expense).
3.  **[Capital Expenditures](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capital-expenditures-capex) ([Fixed Asset Schedule](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capital-expenditures-capex) / [CFI](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-investing-cfi))**
    *   Increases **Gross [PP&E](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#ppe-property-plant--equipment-net)** on the [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) (via Fixed Asset Schedule).
    *   Is a use of cash in **[Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-investing-cfi)**.
4.  **Changes in [Working Capital Accounts](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#working-capital) ([Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet))**
    *   The period-over-period changes in [AR](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#accounts-receivable-ar), [Inventory](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#inventory), [Prepaid Expenses](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#prepaid-expenses), [AP](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#accounts-payable-ap), [Accrued Expenses](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#accrued-expenses), etc., are used to adjust [Net Income](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#net-income) in **[CFO](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo)**.
5.  **[Debt](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) & Interest ([Debt Schedule](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) / [Income Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#income-statement-profit--loss-or-pl) / [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) / [CFF](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-financing-cff))**
    *   **[Interest Expense](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense)** (from Debt Schedule, based on average debt balances and rates) flows to the [Income Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#income-statement-profit--loss-or-pl).
    *   Net change in **[Debt Balances](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt)** (new issuance less repayments, from Debt Schedule) flows to [Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-financing-cff) and updates the Debt lines on the [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet).
6.  **[Equity](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity) Issuance/Repurchases & [Dividends](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#common-dividends) ([Equity Schedule](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity) / [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) / [CFF](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-financing-cff))**
    *   Net change in **[Common Stock](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#common-stock--apic)/[APIC](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#apic-additional-paid-in-capital)/[Treasury Stock](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#treasury-stock)** (from Equity Schedule) flows to [CFF](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-financing-cff) and updates [Equity](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity) lines on the [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet).
    *   **[Dividends](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#common-dividends)** reduce [Retained Earnings](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#retained-earnings) on the [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) and are a use of cash in [CFF](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-financing-cff).
7.  **[Ending Cash Balance](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) ([Cash Flow Statement](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#statement-of-cash-flows))**
    *   The **Cash at End of Period** from the CFS becomes the **[Cash & Cash Equivalents](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash--cash-equivalents)** line item on the current period's [Balance Sheet](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet). This is the ultimate check. If this links correctly and [Assets](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets) = [Liabilities](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#liabilities) + [Equity](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity), the model is "[balanced](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-check-financial-modeling)."

## VI. [Revolver](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#revolving-credit-facility-revolver) / [Cash Sweep](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-sweep-excess-cash-flow-prepayment) Logic (Optional Advanced Step)

For models that include a [revolving credit facility (revolver)](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#revolving-credit-facility-revolver) or a [cash sweep](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-sweep-excess-cash-flow-prepayment) mechanism:

*   After calculating preliminary [Ending Cash](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) (before revolver/sweep), check if it's below a minimum required cash balance or above a target maximum.
*   **If Below Minimum:** Draw on the [revolver](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#revolving-credit-facility-revolver) to bring cash up to the minimum. This increases [Debt](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) on BS and is a source of cash in [CFF](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-financing-cff). [Interest Expense](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense) will increase in future periods.
*   **If Above Maximum (and [cash sweep](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-sweep-excess-cash-flow-prepayment) is active):** Pay down the [revolver](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#revolving-credit-facility-revolver) (or other specified debt) with excess cash. This decreases [Debt](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) on BS and is a use of cash in [CFF](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-financing-cff). [Interest Expense](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense) will decrease.
*   This often creates **[circular references](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#circular-reference-circ)** in [Excel](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#excel) because [interest expense](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense) affects [net income](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#net-income), which affects cash, which affects [debt](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) levels, which in turn affects [interest expense](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense). Enable iterative calculations in [Excel](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#excel) Options or use algebraic solutions/copy-paste values carefully.

## VII. Conclusion for [Credit Analysts](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis)

A well-built [3-statement model](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#3-statement-model) allows a [credit analyst](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) to:

*   **Project Future Financial Performance:** Understand potential [revenue](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#revenue-recognition), [profitability](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#profitability), and [cash flow](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) generation.
*   **Assess Debt Service Capacity:** Calculate key credit [ratios](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#ratio-analysis) ([Leverage](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#leverage-financial), [Interest Coverage](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-coverage-ratio-times-interest-earned---tie), [DSCR](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt-service-coverage-ratio-dscr), [FCCR](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#fixed-charge-coverage-ratio-fccr)) based on forecasted numbers.
*   **Run [Sensitivity](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#sensitivity-analysis) & [Scenario Analysis](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#scenario-analysis):** Test the impact of changes in key [assumptions](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assumption) (e.g., lower revenue growth, higher [interest rates](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk)) on the company's ability to meet its obligations.
*   **Evaluate [Refinancing Risk](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#refinancing-risk):** Analyze future debt maturities and the company's capacity to repay or refinance.
*   **Inform Credit Decisions:** Provide a quantitative basis for loan approvals, pricing, and structuring (e.g., [covenant](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#covenant) setting).

Continuous practice and attention to detail are key to mastering 3-statement modeling. This guide provides the structure; the quality of the model depends on the thoughtfulness of the [assumptions](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assumption) and the rigor of the analysis.

Once proficient with the [3-statement model](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#3-statement-model), this foundation can be extended to more specialized analyses, such as [Leveraged Buyout (LBO)](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#leveraged-buyout-lbo) models. To explore the basics of LBO modeling, see the [Interactive LBO Model Basics Notebook Guide](../../Interactive_Notebooks/Financial_Modeling/LBO_Model_Basics/README.md).
