## Purpose
This placeholder file indicates where a downloadable Excel template for a basic 3-statement (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) financial model would reside.

    *   Income Statement line items
    *   Balance Sheet line items

*   Formulas in projected years link to Input sheet assumptions and other relevant parts of the model.

### Worksheet 3: Balance Sheet (BS)
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Assets:**
        *   Current Assets (Cash & Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses)

*   Key items like Cash (from CFS), Retained Earnings (links to Net Income), PP&E (from PPE schedule), Debt (from Debt schedule) are linked.
*   **Balance Check:** Row at the bottom: Total Assets - (Total Liabilities + Total Equity) -- *MUST ALWAYS BE ZERO*.

### Worksheet 4: Cash Flow Statement (CFS)
*   **Structure (Indirect Method):**
    *   **Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO):**
        *   Net Income
        *   Adjustments (Depreciation & Amortization, Changes in Working Capital items like AR, Inventory, AP, etc.)
    *   **Cash Flow from Investing Activities (CFI):**
        *   Capital Expenditures (Purchase of PP&E)
        *   Proceeds from Sale of PP&E (Optional for basic)
    *   **Cash Flow from Financing Activities (CFF):**
        *   Net Borrowings (Debt Issued - Debt Repaid)

        *   Dividends Paid
    *   Net Change in Cash
    *   Beginning Cash Balance
    *   Ending Cash Balance (This links to Cash on the Balance Sheet)
*   **Format:** Columns for Historical Years and Projected Years.

### Worksheet 5: Supporting Schedules (Examples)
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) Schedule:**
    *   Beginning Gross PP&E
    *   + Capital Expenditures
    *   - Asset Disposals (Cost)
    *   Ending Gross PP&E
    *   Beginning Accumulated Depreciation

*   **Debt Schedule:**
    *   Beginning Debt Balance
    *   + New Debt Issuances
    *   - Debt Repayments
    *   Ending Debt Balance -> Links to BS
    *   Calculation of Interest Expense (based on average debt balance and interest rate) -> Links to IS
*   **Working Capital Schedule (Optional - can be built into BS/CFS directly for basic models):**
    *   Detailed calculation of AR, Inventory, AP based on DSO, DIO, DPO assumptions.

## Best Practices Incorporated (would be visible in the Excel file):
*   Clear separation of inputs, calculations, outputs.
*   Color coding for inputs (e.g., blue font), formulas (black font).
*   Error checks (e.g., Balance Sheet balance check).
*   Logical flow of worksheets.
*   Formulas linking to input sheet or other calculation cells, avoiding hard-coding.
