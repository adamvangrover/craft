# LBO Mechanics & Math

## Introduction to Leveraged Buyouts

A Leveraged Buyout (LBO) is the acquisition of a company using a significant amount of borrowed money (bonds or loans) to meet the cost of acquisition. The assets of the company being acquired are often used as collateral for the loans.

### The Value Creation Equation

Value in an LBO is created through three primary levers:
1.  **Deleveraging**: Using the company's cash flow to pay down the debt used to buy it.
2.  **EBITDA Growth**: Improving operations to increase earnings (and thus exit value).
3.  **Multiple Expansion**: Selling the company for a higher multiple than you bought it for.

### Key Metrics

#### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The discount rate that makes the Net Present Value (NPV) of all cash flows equal to zero.
*   Rule of Thumb: PE firms typically target a 20%+ IRR.

#### Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC)
Total Cash Returned / Total Cash Invested.
*   Example: Invest $100M, Exit with $250M -> 2.5x MOIC.

### The "Paper LBO"

A simplified model used to quickly estimate returns.
*   **Step 1**: Calculate Purchase Price (EBITDA * Entry Multiple).
*   **Step 2**: Determine Debt vs. Equity funding.
*   **Step 3**: Project Free Cash Flow over the holding period (usually 5 years).
*   **Step 4**: Assume all FCF pays down debt.
*   **Step 5**: Calculate Exit Value (Exit EBITDA * Exit Multiple).
*   **Step 6**: Calculate Equity Value at Exit (Exit Value - Remaining Debt).
*   **Step 7**: Calculate IRR and MOIC.
