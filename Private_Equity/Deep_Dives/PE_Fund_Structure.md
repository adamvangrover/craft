# Private Equity Fund Structure

## GP vs. LP

*   **General Partner (GP)**: The PE firm itself. They manage the fund, source deals, and make investment decisions. They have unlimited liability.
*   **Limited Partner (LP)**: The investors (Pension funds, Endowments, Sovereign Wealth Funds). They provide the capital but have limited liability.

## Fees

### Management Fee
Typically 2% of assets under management (AUM) or committed capital. This covers the PE firm's operating expenses (salaries, office, etc.).

### Carried Interest ("Carry")
Typically 20% of the profits. This is the performance fee that aligns incentives. The GP only gets this if they generate returns above a certain threshold (Hurdle Rate).

## The Distribution Waterfall

1.  **Return of Capital**: LPs get their initial investment back first.
2.  **Preferred Return (Hurdle)**: LPs get a guaranteed return (usually 8%) on their capital.
3.  **Catch-Up**: The GP gets caught up to their 20% share of profits.
4.  **Carried Interest**: Splits remaining profits 80% to LPs and 20% to GP.
