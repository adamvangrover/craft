# AGENTS.MD - Data Science Section

## 1. Purpose of This Section

This section explores the intersection of data science and finance. It provides resources for learning how to use data science techniques to analyze financial data, build predictive models, and gain insights into market trends.

## 2. Content Structure

The Data Science section is organized into the following subdirectories:

*   `/Notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with practical examples and tutorials.
*   `/Articles`: In-depth articles on various data science topics in finance.
*   `/Projects`: Larger data science projects with real-world applications.

## 3. Content Creation Guidelines

*   **Code Quality:** All code should be well-documented and follow best practices.
*   **Reproducibility:** Notebooks and projects should be reproducible, with all necessary data and dependencies included.
*   **Practicality:** Focus on practical applications of data science in finance.
*   **Interconnectivity:** Link to other relevant sections within the repository, such as `Financial_Modeling` and `Risk_Management`.

## 4. Future Additions

*   Add more notebooks on topics such as natural language processing (NLP) for financial news analysis and time series analysis for stock price prediction.
*   Create more in-depth articles on advanced data science topics.
*   Develop more complex data science projects with real-world datasets.
