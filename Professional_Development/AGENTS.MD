# Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this directory and its subdirectories.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the overall repository structure and formatting.
*   **Clarity and Actionability:** Content should provide clear, practical, and actionable advice for developing professional skills.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Use Markdown effectively for readability and structure.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure advice and frameworks are sound and generally accepted.
*   **File Naming:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `Effective_Communication_for_Analysts.md`).
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Verify functionality. Link to other relevant sections (e.g., CRAFT for writing examples, CFA for ethics).
*   **Updating Navigation:** When adding new content:
    *   Update `Professional_Development/README.md` (the "Core Content Areas" section).
    *   Update `Professional_Development/index.html` (`filesInDir` JavaScript array).
    *   Consider if `home.html` or the main repository `README.md` need updates.
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Professional Development

### Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review that first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
The `/Professional_Development/` directory focuses on essential "soft skills" and broader professional competencies crucial for success in finance, particularly for analyst roles. This includes communication, critical thinking, presentation skills, negotiation, ethical decision-making, etc.

The main human-readable guide is `Professional_Development/README.md`.
The interactive HTML view is `Professional_Development/index.html`.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   Content is organized by skill area in Markdown files (e.g., `Effective_Communication_for_Analysts.md`, `Critical_Thinking_in_Financial_Analysis.md`).
*   Each file should provide:
    *   An explanation of why the skill is important in a finance context.
    *   Key principles or frameworks related to the skill.
    *   Actionable tips and techniques for improvement.
    *   Examples or short scenarios where applicable.
*   **Development Focus:** Ensure content is practical and provides tangible takeaways for analysts looking to improve these skills. Many files may start as placeholders and require significant content population.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Actionable Advice:** Focus on providing practical, implementable advice rather than just theoretical discussions. Checklists, "do's and don'ts," and simple frameworks are encouraged.
*   **Finance Context:** Always relate the skills back to scenarios and challenges faced by finance professionals (e.g., presenting to a credit committee, writing a concise investment thesis, critically evaluating management assumptions, negotiating terms).
*   **Conciseness:** While thorough, aim to be concise. Professionals are often looking for quick refreshers or targeted tips.
*   **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** Content should be empowering and help users feel they can develop these skills.
*   **Integration, Not Isolation:** Emphasize how these "soft" skills integrate with and enhance "hard" technical skills.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link any specific financial terms used in examples to the `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Connect these soft skills to their application in other parts of the repository:
    *   `Effective_Communication_for_Analysts.md` should link heavily to the CRAFT modules on business writing (Module 5 & 15) and forming a credit narrative (Module 6).
    *   `Critical_Thinking_in_Financial_Analysis.md` should link to analytical sections in CRAFT, Financial Modeling, and Risk Management.
    *   `Ethical_Decision_Making_in_Practice.md` can link to the CFA ethics materials and relevant CRAFT modules (Module 9 & 18).
*   This section is less likely to use Jupyter Notebooks directly, but if a specific interactive exercise (e.g., a quiz on identifying biases) makes sense, refer to `Interactive_Notebooks/AGENTS.MD`.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   Content for placeholder files: `Negotiation_Skills_for_Analysts.md`, `Presentation_Skills_for_Financial_Information.md`, `Ethical_Decision_Making_in_Practice.md`.
*   Future topics: Career Management, Time Management/Productivity, Leadership Skills.
*   Guide to effective networking for finance professionals.
*   Managing stakeholder expectations.

Refer to the root `AGENTS.MD` for general guidelines.
This section is less likely to use Jupyter Notebooks directly, but if a specific interactive exercise makes sense, refer to `Interactive_Notebooks/AGENTS.MD`.
