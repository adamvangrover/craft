# Working Capital

## Introduction

Working capital is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity. It is the difference between a company's current assets and its current liabilities.

**Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**

## Components of Working Capital

- **Current Assets:** Assets that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. Examples include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory.
- **Current Liabilities:** Liabilities that are due within one year. Examples include accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term debt.

## Working Capital Management

Effective working capital management is essential for a company's financial health. It involves managing the components of working capital to ensure that the company has enough cash to meet its short-term obligations.

- **Cash Management:** Ensuring that the company has enough cash on hand to pay its bills.
- **Accounts Receivable Management:** Collecting cash from customers as quickly as possible.
- **Inventory Management:** Minimizing the amount of cash that is tied up in inventory.
- **Accounts Payable Management:** Paying suppliers as slowly as possible without damaging relationships.

## The Cash Conversion Cycle

The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is a metric that measures the number of days it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash.

**CCC = Days of Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payable Outstanding**

A shorter CCC is generally better, as it means that the company is able to convert its investments into cash more quickly.
