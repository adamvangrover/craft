# Case Study: Inventory Valuation (FIFO vs. LIFO)

## 1. Scenario

TechGadget Inc. sells high-end headphones. During a period of rising supplier costs, the company made the following inventory purchases in the first quarter:

*   **January 1:** Beginning Inventory of 100 units @ $50/unit
*   **February 15:** Purchased 200 units @ $55/unit
*   **March 20:** Purchased 150 units @ $60/unit

In the first quarter, TechGadget Inc. sold a total of **300 units**.

**Objective:** Calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and the value of Ending Inventory using both the FIFO and LIFO methods and analyze the impact on the company's gross profit. Assume a sales price of $100 per unit.

## 2. FIFO (First-In, First-Out) Calculation

The FIFO method assumes the first units purchased are the first ones sold.

### Step 1: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
We need to account for the cost of the first 300 units that were available.
*   First 100 units are from Beginning Inventory: `100 units * $50/unit = $5,000`
*   The next 200 units are from the Feb. 15 purchase: `200 units * $55/unit = $11,000`

Total COGS = $5,000 + $11,000 = **$16,000**

### Step 2: Calculate Ending Inventory
We started with 450 units (100 + 200 + 150) and sold 300, leaving 150 units. Under FIFO, the remaining units are the most recently purchased ones.
*   All 150 remaining units are from the March 20 purchase: `150 units * $60/unit = $9,000`

Ending Inventory Value = **$9,000**

---

## 3. LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) Calculation

The LIFO method assumes the last units purchased are the first ones sold.

### Step 1: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
We account for the cost of the last 300 units that were available.
*   First 150 units sold are from the most recent purchase (March 20): `150 units * $60/unit = $9,000`
*   The next 150 units sold are from the Feb. 15 purchase: `150 units * $55/unit = $8,250`

Total COGS = $9,000 + $8,250 = **$17,250**

### Step 2: Calculate Ending Inventory
We have 150 units remaining. Under LIFO, the remaining units are the oldest ones.
*   100 units are from Beginning Inventory: `100 units * $50/unit = $5,000`
*   50 units are from the Feb. 15 purchase: `50 units * $55/unit = $2,750`

Ending Inventory Value = $5,000 + $2,750 = **$7,750**

## 4. Analysis and Impact on Gross Profit

Let's compare the results. Assume total sales revenue is `300 units * $100/unit = $30,000`.

| Metric | FIFO | LIFO | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sales Revenue | $30,000 | $30,000 | $0 |
| **Cost of Goods Sold** | **$16,000** | **$17,250** | **$1,250** |
| **Gross Profit** | **$14,000** | **$12,750** | **$1,250** |
| | | | |
| **Ending Inventory** | **$9,000** | **$7,750** | **$1,250** |

**Conclusion:**
In a period of rising prices, the **LIFO method results in a higher COGS and a lower Gross Profit**. This is because the most recent, more expensive costs are matched against revenue. This leads to lower reported profits and, consequently, a lower income tax liability (a real cash advantage).

Conversely, the **FIFO method results in a lower COGS and a higher Gross Profit**. The balance sheet value of ending inventory is also higher under FIFO, as it reflects the most recent costs. This case study clearly illustrates how the choice of an inventory costing method is a significant accounting policy decision that directly impacts a company's reported profitability and financial position.
