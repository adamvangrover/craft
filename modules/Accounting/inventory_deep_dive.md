# Deep Dive: Inventory

## 1. Introduction to Inventory

Inventory represents the goods and materials a business holds for the ultimate purpose of resale. It is a current asset on the balance sheet and is critical to a company's ability to generate revenue. For retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers, inventory is often one of the largest and most significant assets.

### Types of Inventory
Inventory can be categorized into three main types, particularly for a manufacturing company:
1.  **Raw Materials:** The basic materials that will be used in the production process.
2.  **Work-in-Progress (WIP):** Goods that are partially through the production process but not yet complete.
3.  **Finished Goods:** Completed products that are ready for sale to customers.

## 2. Inventory Costing Methods

When a company purchases inventory at different times and at different prices, it must adopt a cost flow assumption to determine the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the value of ending inventory. The choice of method can have a significant impact on the financial statements.

### First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
The FIFO method assumes that the first units purchased are the first ones sold.
*   **Impact in Rising Prices:** Results in a lower COGS (as older, cheaper costs are used), higher net income, a higher tax liability, and a higher ending inventory value (reflecting more recent, higher costs).
*   **Relevance:** Permitted under both U.S. GAAP and IFRS. It often mirrors the actual physical flow of goods, especially for perishable items.

### Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)
The LIFO method assumes that the last units purchased are the first ones sold.
*   **Impact in Rising Prices:** Results in a higher COGS (as newer, more expensive costs are matched against revenue), lower net income, a lower tax liability (a key advantage), and a lower ending inventory value (which can be outdated).
*   **Relevance:** Permitted under U.S. GAAP but **prohibited** under IFRS. This is a major difference in international accounting.

### Weighted-Average Cost
This method uses the weighted-average cost of all goods available for sale during the period to determine the value of COGS and ending inventory.
`Weighted-Average Cost = Total Cost of Goods Available for Sale / Total Units Available for Sale`
*   **Impact:** Produces results that are between FIFO and LIFO. It smooths out the effects of price changes.

## 3. Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value (LCNRV)

Inventory must be reported on the balance sheet at the **lower of its cost or its net realizable value**. This is a principle of conservatism.

*   **Net Realizable Value (NRV):** The estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
`NRV = Estimated Selling Price - Estimated Costs to Complete & Sell`

If the NRV of inventory falls below its original cost (due to damage, obsolescence, or a decline in market price), the company must write down the value of the inventory to its NRV. This write-down is recognized as a loss on the income statement in the period the decline occurs.

## 4. Inventory Ratios

Analysts use several ratios to assess how efficiently a company is managing its inventory.

### Inventory Turnover
This ratio measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory over a period.
`Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory`
*   A high turnover generally indicates strong sales or effective inventory management. A low turnover might suggest weak sales or overstocking.

### Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)
This ratio measures the average number of days it takes for a company to sell its inventory.
`Days Inventory Outstanding = 365 / Inventory Turnover`
*   A lower DIO is generally better, as it indicates the company is converting its inventory into sales more quickly.

Comparing these ratios to industry averages and historical trends is crucial for a meaningful analysis.
