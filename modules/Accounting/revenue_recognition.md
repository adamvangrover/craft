# Revenue Recognition

The new revenue recognition standards (ASC 606 and IFRS 15) have had a significant impact on how companies recognize revenue. The new standards are based on a single, principles-based model that is designed to be more consistent and comparable across industries.

## The Five-Step Model

The new revenue recognition model is based on five steps:

1.  **Identify the contract with the customer.**
2.  **Identify the performance obligations in the contract.**
3.  **Determine the transaction price.**
4.  **Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.**
5.  **Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.**

## Key Changes

The new revenue recognition standards have resulted in a number of key changes, including:

*   **More judgmental application:** The new standards are more principles-based than the old standards, which means that companies will have to use more judgment in applying them.
*   **More disclosures:** The new standards require companies to provide more disclosures about their revenue recognition policies and practices.
*   **More volatility in revenue:** The new standards may result in more volatility in revenue for some companies, as revenue will be recognized over time rather than at a single point in time.

## Impact on Financial Analysis

The new revenue recognition standards will have a significant impact on financial analysis. Analysts will need to understand the new standards in order to properly analyze a company's financial statements.

Some of the key things that analysts will need to consider include:

*   **The company's revenue recognition policies:** Analysts will need to understand how the company is applying the new standards and whether its policies are appropriate.
*   **The company's performance obligations:** Analysts will need to understand what the company's performance obligations are and when they are satisfied.
*   **The company's transaction price:** Analysts will need to understand how the company is determining the transaction price and whether it is appropriate.
*   **The company's allocation of the transaction price:** Analysts will need to understand how the company is allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations and whether it is appropriate.
*   **The company's disclosures:** Analysts will need to carefully review the company's disclosures about its revenue recognition policies and practices.
