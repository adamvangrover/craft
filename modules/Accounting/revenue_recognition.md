# Revenue Recognition

Revenue recognition is a cornerstone of accrual accounting, dictating the specific conditions under which a company can recognize revenue. The principle, governed by standards like ASC 606 and IFRS 15, ensures that revenue is recognized when it is earned and realized or realizable, regardless of when cash is received.

## The Five-Step Model for Revenue Recognition (ASC 606 / IFRS 15)

ASC 606 provides a comprehensive, converged framework for all entities to apply to revenue recognition. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

The five steps are:

### 1. Identify the Contract(s) with a Customer
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. It can be written, oral, or implied by an entity's customary business practices. The standard specifies that for a contract to be identified, it must meet certain criteria, including being approved by both parties and having commercial substance.

### 2. Identify the Performance Obligations in the Contract
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or with other readily available resources, and the promise to transfer it is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.

### 3. Determine the Transaction Price
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services. This can include fixed amounts, variable amounts (e.g., bonuses, penalties), or non-cash consideration. The price should be estimated considering factors like the time value of money if there's a significant financing component.

### 4. Allocate the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations
If a contract has multiple performance obligations, the entity must allocate the transaction price to each one based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer.

### 5. Recognize Revenue When (or as) the Entity Satisfies a Performance Obligation
An entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. This can happen at a **point in time** (e.g., delivering a product) or **over time** (e.g., providing a consulting service over a year). Revenue is recognized in a pattern that reflects this transfer of control.

## Comprehensive Example: Software Co.

Let's consider a company, "Software Co.", that sells a software license along with installation services and technical support.

*   **Contract:** A customer signs a contract for a software license, installation, and one year of technical support for a total price of $120,000.
*   **Standalone Selling Prices:**
    *   Software License: $100,000
    *   Installation Service: $15,000
    *   Technical Support: $10,000
    *   Total Standalone Price: $125,000

**Applying the 5-Step Model:**

1.  **Identify the Contract:** The signed agreement for $120,000 is the contract.

2.  **Identify Performance Obligations:** There are three distinct performance obligations:
    *   The software license.
    *   The installation service.
    *   The one-year of technical support.

3.  **Determine Transaction Price:** The transaction price is $120,000.

4.  **Allocate the Transaction Price:** The allocation is based on the relative standalone selling prices.
    *   License: `$120,000 * ($100,000 / $125,000) = $96,000`
    *   Installation: `$120,000 * ($15,000 / $125,000) = $14,400`
    *   Support: `$120,000 * ($10,000 / $125,000) = $9,600`

5.  **Recognize Revenue:**
    *   **Software License:** Revenue of **$96,000** is recognized when the license key is delivered and the customer can use the software (control is transferred at a point in time).
    *   **Installation Service:** Revenue of **$14,400** is recognized when the installation is complete (point in time).
    *   **Technical Support:** Revenue of **$9,600** is recognized ratably over the one-year support period (e.g., $800 per month), as the service is delivered over time.

## Impact on Financial Analysis

The new revenue recognition standards will have a significant impact on financial analysis. Analysts will need to understand the new standards in order to properly analyze a company's financial statements.

Some of the key things that analysts will need to consider include:

*   **The company's revenue recognition policies:** Analysts will need to understand how the company is applying the new standards and whether its policies are appropriate.
*   **The company's performance obligations:** Analysts will need to understand what the company's performance obligations are and when they are satisfied.
*   **The company's transaction price:** Analysts will need to understand how the company is determining the transaction price and whether it is appropriate.
*   **The company's allocation of the transaction price:** Analysts will need to understand how the company is allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations and whether it is appropriate.
*   **The company's disclosures:** Analysts will need to carefully review the company's disclosures about its revenue recognition policies and practices.
