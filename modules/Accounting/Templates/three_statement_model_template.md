This template provides a basic structure for building a three-statement financial model.

## Instructions

2. **Make assumptions:** Enter your assumptions for the forecast period in the "Assumptions" tab.
3. **Forecast the income statement:** Use the assumptions to forecast the company's income statement.

## Model Structure

The model is organized into the following tabs:

- **Assumptions:** This tab contains all of the assumptions that drive the model.
- **Income Statement:** This tab contains the historical and forecasted income statement.
- **Balance Sheet:** This tab contains the historical and forecasted balance sheet.
- **Cash Flow Statement:** This tab contains the historical and forecasted cash flow statement.
- **Supporting Schedules:** This tab contains any supporting schedules that are needed to build the model, such as a depreciation schedule or a debt schedule.

## Key Formulas

- **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**
- **Cash Flow from Operations = Net Income + Non-Cash Charges +/- Changes in Working Capital**
- **Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Cash Flow from Operations + Cash Flow from Investing + Cash Flow from Financing**
- **Retained Earnings = Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends**
