# Balancing the Statements

## Introduction

The three financial statements are intricately linked. Understanding how they balance is crucial for financial analysis. The balance sheet, in particular, must always be in balance, with assets equaling the sum of liabilities and equity.

## The Accounting Equation

The fundamental equation that governs the balance sheet is:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

This equation must hold true at all times. Every transaction that a company records will have a dual effect, ensuring that the equation remains in balance.

## The Role of Debits and Credits

Double-entry bookkeeping is the system used to record financial transactions. In this system, every transaction has two entries: a debit and a credit.

- **Debits** increase asset and expense accounts and decrease liability, equity, and revenue accounts.
- **Credits** increase liability, equity, and revenue accounts and decrease asset and expense accounts.

For every transaction, the total amount of debits must equal the total amount of credits, which ensures that the accounting equation remains in balance.

## Example

A company purchases $500 of inventory on credit.

- **The transaction:** The company's inventory (an asset) increases by $500, and its accounts payable (a liability) also increases by $500.
- **The journal entry:**
  - Debit Inventory: $500
  - Credit Accounts Payable: $500
- **The impact on the accounting equation:**
  - Assets increase by $500.
  - Liabilities increase by $500.
  - The equation remains in balance.

## Linking the Statements

The income statement and cash flow statement are linked to the balance sheet in a way that ensures everything stays in balance.

- **Net income** from the income statement increases retained earnings, which is a component of equity on the balance sheet.
- The **ending cash balance** from the cash flow statement is the cash balance on the balance sheet.
- **Changes in working capital** on the cash flow statement are reflected in the changes in current assets and current liabilities on the balance sheet.
