# Going Concern

## Introduction

The going concern assumption is a fundamental principle of accounting. It assumes that a company will continue to operate for the foreseeable future, which is generally considered to be at least the next 12 months.

## Management's Responsibility

Management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment must be made at least annually. If management has substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, it must disclose this in the financial statements.

## Auditor's Responsibility

The auditor is responsible for evaluating management's assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If the auditor has substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, the auditor must include an explanatory paragraph in the audit report.

## Importance of the Going Concern Assumption

The going concern assumption is important because it affects how assets and liabilities are valued. If a company is not a going concern, its assets may need to be written down to their liquidation value, and its liabilities may need to be reclassified as current.
