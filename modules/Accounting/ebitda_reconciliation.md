# EBITDA Reconciliation

## Introduction

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used to assess a company's operating performance. While it can be a useful metric, it is important to understand how it is calculated and what it represents.

## Calculation

EBITDA is typically calculated by starting with net income and adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

**EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization**

## Reconciliation to Net Income

Companies that report EBITDA are required to provide a reconciliation of EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is typically net income. This reconciliation helps investors to understand the differences between the two measures.

## Example

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Net Income | $100,000 |
| Interest Expense | $20,000 |
| Tax Expense | $30,000 |
| Depreciation | $40,000 |
| Amortization | $10,000 |
| **EBITDA** | **$200,000** |

## Uses and Limitations

- **Uses:**
  - Can be used to compare the operating performance of companies in the same industry.
  - Can be used to assess a company's ability to service its debt.
- **Limitations:**
  - Does not account for changes in working capital.
  - Can be misleading if not used in conjunction with other financial metrics.
  - Is not a substitute for cash flow from operations.
