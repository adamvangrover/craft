# Free Cash Flow (FCF) Walk

## Introduction

A Free Cash Flow (FCF) walk, also known as a cash flow bridge, is a visual representation of the sources and uses of cash that reconciles a company's net income to its free cash flow. This is a valuable tool for understanding a company's cash generation and how it is being used.

## Components of a FCF Walk

A FCF walk typically starts with net income and then makes the following adjustments:

- **Add back non-cash charges:** Depreciation and amortization are added back because they are non-cash expenses.
- **Adjust for changes in working capital:**
  - Increases in current assets (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory) are a use of cash and are subtracted.
  - Decreases in current assets are a source of cash and are added.
  - Increases in current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, accrued expenses) are a source of cash and are added.
  - Decreases in current liabilities are a use of cash and are subtracted.
- **Subtract capital expenditures:** Capital expenditures are a use of cash and are subtracted.

## Example

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Net Income | $100,000 |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $50,000 |
| (Increase) in Accounts Receivable | ($10,000) |

| Increase in Accounts Payable | $15,000 |
| **Cash Flow from Operations** | **$135,000** |
| Capital Expenditures | ($40,000) |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **$95,000** |
