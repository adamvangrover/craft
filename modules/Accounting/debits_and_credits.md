# Debits and Credits

## Introduction

Debits and credits are the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. For every transaction, there is at least one debit and one credit, and the total value of the debits must equal the total value of the credits.

## The Rules of Debits and Credits

| Account Type | To Increase | To Decrease |
|---|---|---|
| **Assets** | Debit | Credit |
| **Liabilities** | Credit | Debit |
| **Equity** | Credit | Debit |
| **Revenue** | Credit | Debit |
| **Expenses** | Debit | Credit |

A helpful mnemonic for remembering the rules of debits and credits is **DEAD Clic**:
- **D**ebits increase **E**xpenses, **A**ssets, and **D**ividends.
- **C**redits increase **L**iabilities, **I**ncome (Revenue), and **C**apital (Equity).

## T-Accounts

A T-account is a visual representation of an account. The left side of the T-account is for debits, and the right side is for credits.

```
      Account Name
-------------------------
Debits       |      Credits
             |
```

## Example

A company receives a $1,000 cash payment from a customer for services rendered.

- **The transaction:** Cash (an asset) increases, and service revenue (a revenue account) increases.
- **The journal entry:**
  - Debit Cash: $1,000
  - Credit Service Revenue: $1,000

This transaction increases both assets and equity, keeping the accounting equation in balance.
