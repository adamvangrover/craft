# 3.3 Financial Covenants & Documentation

This sub-module introduces the legal underpinnings of a credit relationship. It demystifies the credit agreement, focusing on the key provisions that protect the lender. The primary focus is on financial covenants—the performance metrics a borrower must maintain to remain in good standing.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and describe the key sections of a standard credit agreement (e.g., Definitions, Loan Terms, Covenants, Events of Default).
- Differentiate between affirmative covenants (what the borrower must do) and negative covenants (what the borrower cannot do).
- Define the most common financial covenants, including Leverage and Interest Coverage ratios.
- Calculate a company's compliance with its financial covenants using data from its financial statements and the specific definitions in the credit agreement.

## Key Concepts Outline

### Introduction to the Credit Agreement
The credit agreement (or facilities agreement) is the legally binding contract that governs the terms of the loan.106

**Key Sections for an Analyst to Understand 106:**
- **Article 1: Definitions:** Crucial section that defines all key terms used in the agreement, including the precise calculation for financial covenants (e.g., the definition of "EBITDA" or "Debt").
- **Article 2: The Commitments and Credit Extensions:** Details the loan amounts, types of loans (e.g., revolver, term loan), interest rates, fees, and repayment schedules.
- **Article 4: Conditions Precedent:** Items that must be completed before the loan can be funded.
- **Article 5: Representations and Warranties:** Statements of fact made by the borrower about its business and financial condition at the time the loan is made. A breach can trigger a default.
- **Article 7: Covenants:** The rules of the road for the borrower during the life of the loan.
- **Article 8: Events of Default:** Specific events that constitute a breach of the agreement, giving the lender the right to take remedial action (e.g., accelerate repayment).

### Understanding Covenants: The Rules of the Road
Covenants are promises made by the borrower to the lender, designed to protect the lender's investment by ensuring the borrower operates in a financially sound manner.109

- **Affirmative (Positive) Covenants:** Specify actions the borrower **must** take.109 Examples include:
  - Providing regular financial statements (quarterly and annual).
  - Paying taxes on time.
  - Maintaining proper insurance.
  - Maintaining corporate existence.
- **Negative Covenants:** Specify actions the borrower **cannot** take without the lender's consent. These are designed to prevent actions that could increase the lender's risk.109 Examples include:
  - **Limitation on Liens:** Prevents the borrower from pledging assets to other creditors.
  - **Limitation on Indebtedness:** Restricts the amount of additional debt the borrower can incur.
  - **Limitation on Asset Sales:** Restricts the sale of significant assets.
  - **Limitation on Restricted Payments:** Limits the amount of cash that can be paid out to shareholders as dividends or for share buybacks.

### Financial Covenants: The Performance Scorecard
These are numerical tests, typically calculated quarterly, that measure the borrower's financial health against pre-defined thresholds.110 A breach of a financial covenant is a clear early warning sign of deteriorating performance.112

**Common Financial Covenants and Their Calculation 111:**
- **Leverage Ratio (Maximum):** Measures the level of debt relative to cash flow.
  - **Formula:** Total Debt / EBITDA ≤ X.Xx
  - **Example:** If the covenant is ≤ 3.50x and the company's ratio is 3.75x, it is in breach.
- **Interest Coverage Ratio (Minimum):** Measures the ability of cash flow to cover interest expense.
  - **Formula:** EBITDA / Total Interest Expense ≥ X.Xx
  - **Example:** If the covenant is ≥ 2.50x and the company's ratio is 2.25x, it is in breach.
- **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (Minimum):** A broader measure of repayment capacity.
  - **Formula:** (EBITDA − Unfunded CapEx − Taxes) / (Interest + Scheduled Principal Payments) ≥ X.Xx
- **Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (Minimum):** Similar to DSCR but often includes other fixed charges like lease payments.111

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with a one-page excerpt from a credit agreement's "Definitions" and "Financial Covenants" sections. The excerpt defines "Consolidated EBITDA" and "Total Debt" and sets a maximum Leverage Ratio of 4.00x. Also provide a company's simplified income statement and balance sheet. The task is to use the specific definitions from the credit agreement to calculate Consolidated EBITDA, Total Debt, and the Leverage Ratio, and then determine if the company is in compliance with its covenant.

### Assessment Method

A quiz requiring trainees to identify whether specific clauses are affirmative, negative, or financial covenants. The primary assessment will be the review of the covenant calculation exercise for accuracy, particularly the trainee's ability to follow the precise definitions provided in the sample credit agreement.
