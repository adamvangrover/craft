# 4.2 Debt Structuring & Capital Structure

This sub-module provides a detailed examination of how a company's liabilities are organized. It explains the concept of the "capital stack" and the principle of priority of payment, which are fundamental to assessing recovery prospects in a default scenario.

## Learning Objectives

- Illustrate the capital structure hierarchy and explain the principle of absolute priority in a bankruptcy scenario.
- Differentiate between the key features of various corporate debt instruments, including revolvers, term loans, and bonds.
- Define structural subordination and explain how it can impact a creditor's claim on assets.
- Analyze a company's capital structure to determine the relative seniority and security of a specific debt instrument.

## Key Concepts Outline

### The Capital Structure Hierarchy (The "Capital Stack")
Capital structure refers to the mix of debt and equity a company uses to finance its assets.126
The hierarchy, or "stack," represents the priority of claims on a company's assets and cash flows in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. Instruments at the top of the stack have the highest priority and are the least risky; those at the bottom have the lowest priority and are the most risky.128

**The Principle of Absolute Priority:** In a bankruptcy, creditors at the top of the hierarchy must be paid in full before any value can be distributed to the class below them.128

**Typical Hierarchy (from highest to lowest priority):**
1.  **Senior Secured Debt** (e.g., Revolvers, Term Loan A, Term Loan B): Has the first claim on company assets, specifically on the collateral pledged to secure the debt.128
2.  **Senior Unsecured Debt** (e.g., High-Yield Bonds): Has a general claim on the company's assets but ranks behind secured creditors with respect to the pledged collateral.128
3.  **Subordinated Debt** (e.g., Mezzanine Debt): Contractually ranks behind senior debt. Holders are only paid after all senior creditors are satisfied.129
4.  **Preferred Stock:** A hybrid instrument that ranks ahead of common stock but behind all debt.
5.  **Common Equity:** The residual claimants. Equity holders are paid last and often receive nothing in a bankruptcy.127

### Understanding Different Debt Instruments
Companies use a variety of debt instruments to meet different financing needs.131

- **Bank Debt (Senior Loans):**
  - **Revolving Credit Facility (Revolver):** A corporate credit card used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The company can borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to a specified limit. Typically senior secured.115
  - **Term Loan A (TLA):** An amortizing loan, meaning the principal is paid down gradually over the life of the loan. Typically held by banks and has a shorter maturity (e.g., 5-7 years).115
  - **Term Loan B (TLB):** A loan with minimal principal amortization (e.g., 1% per year) and a large "bullet" payment at maturity. Typically held by institutional investors like CLOs and has a longer maturity than a TLA.121
- **Bonds (Notes):**
  - **High-Yield Bonds:** Unsecured debt sold to institutional investors. Typically have fixed interest rates, bullet maturities (no amortization), and less restrictive "incurrence" covenants.115
  - **Mezzanine Debt:** A subordinated instrument that often includes an equity component (like warrants) to enhance returns for the investor, compensating for its high risk.118

### The Concept of Structural Subordination
This is a critical concept in companies with a holding company (Parent) and operating subsidiary structure.134
**Definition:** Creditors who lend to the Parent company are structurally subordinated to creditors who lend directly to the operating Subsidiary. In a bankruptcy, the Subsidiary's creditors must be paid in full from the Subsidiary's assets before any remaining value (as equity) can be distributed "upstream" to the Parent to pay its creditors.135
**Mitigant:** To overcome structural subordination, lenders to a holding company will almost always require the operating subsidiaries to provide an "upstream guarantee" of the parent's debt, making them directly liable as well.130

### Table 2: Comparison of Corporate Debt Instruments

| Instrument                | Typical Lender                       | Seniority        | Security            | Tenor      | Repayment Profile                          | Key Characteristics/Use Case                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Revolving Credit Facility | Commercial Banks                     | Senior           | Secured (First Lien) | 3-5 years  | None (borrow & repay as needed)            | Working capital, liquidity backstop, letter of credit issuance. |
| Term Loan A (TLA)         | Commercial Banks                     | Senior           | Secured (First Lien) | 5-7 years  | Amortizing (e.g., 5-10% per year)          | General corporate purposes, smaller acquisitions, capital expenditures. |
| Term Loan B (TLB)         | Institutional (CLOs, Funds)          | Senior           | Secured (First Lien) | 6-8 years  | Minimal Amortization (e.g., 1% per year) with Bullet | LBOs, larger acquisitions, dividend recapitalizations.      |
| High-Yield Bonds          | Institutional (Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds) | Senior Unsecured | Unsecured           | 7-10 years | Bullet (no amortization)                   | LBOs, refinancing, growth capital for non-investment grade companies. |
| Mezzanine Debt            | Specialized Funds                    | Subordinated     | Unsecured           | 8-12 years | Bullet (no amortization)                   | Growth capital, acquisition financing; often includes equity warrants. |

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with an organizational chart for a company with a holding company ("HoldCo") and two operating subsidiaries ("OpCo 1" and "OpCo 2"). The capital structure includes a Term Loan B at OpCo 1 and Senior Unsecured Bonds issued by HoldCo. Trainees must draw a diagram of the capital structure, rank the instruments by priority, and write a short paragraph explaining why the bondholders are structurally subordinated to the term loan lenders and what legal feature they would seek to mitigate this risk.

### Assessment Method

Evaluation of the capital structure diagram and the written explanation for correctness. The assessment will focus on the trainee's ability to correctly identify and explain the concept of structural subordination and its common mitigant (an upstream guarantee).
