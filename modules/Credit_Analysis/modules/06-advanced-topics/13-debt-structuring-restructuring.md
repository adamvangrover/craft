# Module 13: Debt Structuring & Restructuring

## 13.1. Introduction to Debt Structuring
Debt structuring is the process of designing a debt financing package that meets the needs of a borrower while providing appropriate risk protection and return for lenders. It involves determining the optimal mix of debt instruments, maturities, security, covenants, and pricing. Effective debt structuring is crucial for both issuers (to ensure they have the capital they need on manageable terms) and for creditors (to safeguard their investment and ensure repayment).

**Key Objectives in Debt Structuring:**

*   **For the Borrower:**
    *   Secure sufficient capital to meet funding needs (e.g., for growth, acquisitions, refinancing, working capital).
    *   Achieve the lowest possible cost of debt (interest rates, fees).
    *   Obtain appropriate tenors (maturities) that align with asset lives or project timelines.
    *   Maintain adequate financial and operational flexibility (e.g., through covenant headroom, ability to incur additional debt if needed).
    *   Diversify funding sources.
*   **For the Lender/Investor:**
    *   Ensure a return commensurate with the risk taken (interest, fees).
    *   Protect principal investment through appropriate security, seniority, and covenants.
    *   Ensure timely repayment of principal and interest.
    *   Provide early warning signals and remedies in case of deteriorating credit quality.

**Key Elements Considered in Debt Structuring:**

1.  **Amount and Purpose of Debt:** How much is needed and what will it be used for? This drives the type and tenor of debt.
2.  **Type of Debt Instruments:** (Covered in Module 3)
    *   Revolving Credit Facilities, Term Loans (A, B, C), Senior Notes, Subordinated Notes, Mezzanine Debt, etc.
    *   The choice depends on the purpose, desired flexibility, market conditions, and borrower's credit profile.
3.  **Seniority and Ranking:** Where will the new debt sit in the capital structure (e.g., senior secured, senior unsecured, subordinated)? This directly impacts its risk and pricing.
4.  **Security (Collateral):**
    *   Will the debt be secured by specific assets (e.g., receivables, inventory, PP&E, intellectual property) or all assets?
    *   What is the quality, value, and liquidity of the collateral? (Lien priority: first lien, second lien).
5.  **Tenor (Maturity):**
    *   The length of time until the principal must be repaid. Should align with the borrower's repayment capacity and the life of assets being financed.
    *   Shorter tenors are generally less risky for lenders.
6.  **Repayment Schedule (Amortization):**
    *   **Amortizing Loans:** Require periodic principal payments over the life of the loan (e.g., Term Loan A).
    *   **Bullet Maturity:** Full principal repayment at the maturity date (common for bonds, Term Loan B).
    *   **Cash Flow Sweep:** Mandatory prepayment of principal using a percentage of excess cash flow.
7.  **Pricing (Interest Rate & Fees):**
    *   **Interest Rate:**
        *   *Fixed Rate:* Common for bonds.
        *   *Floating Rate:* Common for bank loans (e.g., SOFR + Credit Spread/Margin). The credit spread compensates lenders for the borrower's credit risk.
    *   **Fees:** Upfront fees (origination/underwriting fees), commitment fees (on undrawn revolvers), administrative agent fees, prepayment penalties (call protection for bonds).
8.  **Covenants:** (Covered in Module 3)
    *   Affirmative, Negative, and Financial covenants tailored to the borrower's specific risks and industry.
    *   The tightness of covenants (headroom) is a key negotiation point.
9.  **Optionality:**
    *   **Call Provisions (for bonds):** Issuer's right to redeem bonds before maturity, often at a premium.
    *   **Prepayment Rights (for loans):** Borrower's ability to repay loans early, sometimes with prepayment fees.
    *   **Conversion Features (for convertible debt):** Holder's right to convert debt into equity.

**The Process of Structuring a Deal:**
Often involves iterative discussions between the borrower, financial advisors (investment banks), and potential lead lenders. Market conditions (investor appetite, prevailing interest rates, comparable deals) heavily influence what terms are achievable.

## 13.2. Advanced Covenant Considerations in Debt Structuring
While Module 3 introduced covenants, effective debt structuring involves nuanced considerations:

*   **Defining "EBITDA" and Other Key Terms:** As stressed before, the precise definition of terms used in financial covenants (especially EBITDA, Debt, Net Debt, Interest Expense, Fixed Charges) is critical. Lenders push for tight, conservative definitions; borrowers seek more flexibility (e.g., more add-backs to EBITDA).
*   **Covenant Headroom/Cushion:** The amount of leeway a borrower has before breaching a financial covenant.
    *   Too tight: Risks frequent technical defaults even with minor operational hiccups.
    *   Too loose: May not provide an effective early warning signal.
    *   Typically set based on projections, with a cushion (e.g., 15-30%) to absorb some underperformance.
*   **Equity Cure Rights:** A provision allowing equity holders (often PE sponsors) to contribute additional equity to the company to "cure" a financial covenant breach (e.g., by increasing EBITDA or reducing debt for covenant calculation purposes). Lenders usually limit the number of times and the extent to which these can be used.
*   **Negative Covenant Baskets and Builders:**
    *   **Baskets:** Fixed amounts or amounts based on a percentage of assets/EBITDA that allow the borrower to undertake certain restricted actions (e.g., incur additional debt, make investments, pay dividends) without specific lender consent, provided they are within these pre-agreed limits.
    *   **Builder Baskets (Accumulating Baskets):** Capacity for restricted actions (especially dividends/restricted payments) can "build up" over time based on a percentage of cumulative net income or other performance metrics, subject to certain conditions (e.g., no default, meeting a leverage test).
*   **Springing Covenants:** Covenants that only come into effect if a certain event occurs (e.g., a financial covenant that only applies if a revolving credit facility is drawn beyond a certain percentage). Common in covenant-lite deals for revolvers.
*   **Portability:** Provisions that determine whether existing debt can remain in place (or if it triggers a change of control requiring repayment) if the company is sold.

## 13.3. Introduction to Debt Restructuring
Debt restructuring becomes necessary when a company is facing financial distress and is unable to meet its existing debt obligations (interest or principal payments). The goal of restructuring is typically to allow the company to continue operating as a going concern by right-sizing its debt burden to a sustainable level.

**Common Triggers for Debt Restructuring:**
*   Imminent or actual payment default.
*   Breach of financial covenants with no prospect of an easy cure or waiver.
*   Severe liquidity crisis.
*   Unsustainable capital structure due to operational underperformance or excessive leverage.

**Key Objectives of Debt Restructuring:**

*   **For the Company:**
    *   Reduce overall debt burden.
    *   Lower interest expense.
    *   Extend debt maturities.
    *   Obtain covenant relief.
    *   Improve liquidity and restore financial viability.
    *   Avoid bankruptcy if possible.
*   **For Creditors:**
    *   Maximize recovery on their claims.
    *   Achieve a better outcome than immediate liquidation/bankruptcy.
    *   Potentially gain equity or other instruments in the restructured company.
    *   Ensure the restructured company has a viable business plan.

**Common Restructuring Methods (Out-of-Court or In-Court):**

*   **Amendment of Existing Terms (Amend & Extend):**
    *   Lenders agree to modify terms: extend maturity, temporarily reduce interest/principal, waive covenants, often in exchange for fees, higher interest rates prospectively, or additional collateral/equity.
*   **Debt-for-Equity Swaps:**
    *   Creditors exchange some or all of their debt claims for an equity stake in the company. This de-levers the balance sheet but dilutes existing shareholders. Common for subordinated or unsecured debtholders.
*   **Debt-for-Debt Swaps:**
    *   Exchanging existing debt for new debt with different terms (e.g., longer maturity, lower coupon, but potentially higher principal or better security).
*   **Haircuts on Principal:**
    *   Creditors agree to forgive a portion of the principal owed. This is more common for junior creditors.
*   **New Money Injection:**
    *   Often required to fund turnaround plans or provide liquidity. New money providers (existing lenders or new investors) typically demand seniority or preferential terms.
*   **Asset Sales:**
    *   Company sells non-core assets to generate cash to pay down debt.

**Out-of-Court vs. In-Court Restructuring:**

*   **Out-of-Court Restructuring (Workouts):**
    *   Negotiated directly between the company and its key creditors without formal bankruptcy proceedings.
    *   **Pros:** Faster, cheaper, less disruptive to business operations, more flexible.
    *   **Cons:** Requires unanimous or very high consent from all affected creditor classes (holdout creditors can be a problem). Cannot bind non-consenting creditors. Limited ability to reject burdensome contracts or leases.
*   **In-Court Restructuring (e.g., Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the U.S.):**
    *   Formal legal process overseen by a bankruptcy court.
    *   **Pros:** Can bind dissenting creditors within a class if requisite voting thresholds are met (cramdown). Provides an automatic stay against creditor actions. Allows the company to reject unfavorable contracts/leases. Can facilitate orderly asset sales. Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) financing often available with super-priority status.
    *   **Cons:** More expensive, time-consuming, public, potentially disruptive to business (customer/supplier concerns). Loss of control by existing equity/management to some extent.

## 13.4. Overview of Distressed Debt Analysis (Creditor's Perspective)
When a company's debt trades at a significant discount to par value, or the company is clearly heading towards default or restructuring, it enters the realm of "distressed debt." Analyzing distressed debt requires a specialized skill set.

**Key Focus Areas for Distressed Debt Analysts/Investors:**

*   **Likelihood of Default & Timing:** Assessing if and when a default or restructuring is likely.
*   **Recovery Analysis (Valuation in Distress):** This is paramount.
    *   Estimating the company's value in various scenarios (e.g., going concern value if restructured, liquidation value if assets are sold off).
    *   Determining the priority of claims based on the capital structure (absolute priority rule, though deviations occur).
    *   Estimating potential recovery rates for each class of debt (e.g., cents on the dollar). Senior secured debt typically has the highest recovery, subordinated/unsecured much lower.
*   **Understanding Legal Rights & Protections:**
    *   Deep dive into credit agreements, bond indentures, and intercreditor agreements to understand the rights and remedies of each creditor class.
    *   Analyzing collateral packages and lien perfection for secured debt.
*   **Liquidity Analysis & Cash Burn:** How much time does the company have before it runs out of cash?
*   **Business Viability & Turnaround Plan:** Is the core business salvageable? Is management's turnaround plan credible?
*   **Identifying a Fulcrum Security:** The debt instrument in the capital structure that is expected to be converted to equity in a restructuring (i.e., the most senior impaired class that will receive equity). Holders of the fulcrum security often have significant influence over the restructuring process.
*   **Potential Restructuring Outcomes:** Modeling different restructuring scenarios and their impact on various creditor classes.
*   **Trading Dynamics & Market Information:** Distressed debt markets can be illiquid and driven by specialized investors.

## 13.5. Introduction to Chapter 11 Bankruptcy (U.S. Context)
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a framework for companies to reorganize their financial affairs while continuing to operate, under the supervision of a bankruptcy court. It is a common tool for implementing complex debt restructurings.

**Key Features & Concepts of Chapter 11:**

*   **Automatic Stay:** Upon filing, an automatic stay immediately halts most creditor actions against the company (lawsuits, foreclosures, collection efforts), providing breathing room for reorganization.
*   **Debtor-in-Possession (DIP):** The company's existing management typically remains in control of the business operations as a "debtor-in-possession," unless a trustee is appointed for cause (e.g., fraud, gross mismanagement).
*   **DIP Financing:** Companies in Chapter 11 can obtain new financing (DIP loans) to fund operations during the bankruptcy. DIP lenders are often granted "super-priority" status, meaning their claims rank ahead of most pre-petition debt.
*   **Plan of Reorganization (POR):** The debtor (or sometimes creditors) proposes a POR detailing how creditor claims will be treated (e.g., paid in full, impaired, converted to equity) and how the company will emerge from bankruptcy as a viable entity.
*   **Creditors' Committees:** Official committees (e.g., Unsecured Creditors' Committee) are often appointed to represent the interests of different creditor classes in negotiating the POR.
*   **Disclosure Statement:** A document accompanying the POR that provides creditors with adequate information to make an informed decision on whether to vote for or against the plan.
*   **Voting & Confirmation:** Impaired creditor classes vote on the POR. For a plan to be confirmed by the court, it generally needs acceptance by at least one impaired class, and it must meet various legal requirements (e.g., feasibility, best interests of creditors test).
*   **Cramdown:** If a class of creditors rejects the plan, the court can still confirm it over their objection (a "cramdown") if certain conditions are met, including that the plan is "fair and equitable" and does not discriminate unfairly.
*   **Absolute Priority Rule (APR):** A fundamental principle stating that senior creditors must be paid in full before junior creditors receive any recovery, and creditors must be paid in full before equity holders receive anything. While a guiding principle, deviations ("APR violations") can occur in negotiated plans.
*   **Executory Contracts & Unexpired Leases:** The debtor can assume (continue) or reject burdensome contracts and leases, subject to court approval.

**Implications for Creditors:**
Chapter 11 provides an orderly process but can be lengthy and expensive. Creditors' recoveries depend on their position in the capital structure, the value of the reorganized company (or its liquidated assets), and their ability to negotiate effectively within the bankruptcy process. Understanding the legal framework and potential outcomes is crucial for any creditor involved with a distressed company.

## 13.6. Student Notes & Reflections

As you work through this module, consider the following questions and jot down your thoughts:

1.  **Debt Structuring Objectives:**
    *   When a company is structuring new debt, how might its objectives (e.g., lowest cost, maximum flexibility) conflict with a lender's objectives (e.g., principal protection, adequate return for risk)? How are these conflicts typically resolved?
    *   What are some specific features a lender might want in a debt structure for a highly cyclical or speculative-grade borrower?

2.  **Covenant Negotiations:**
    *   Why is the definition of "EBITDA" in a credit agreement so heavily negotiated? Give an example of an "add-back" a borrower might want that a lender might resist.
    *   What is an "equity cure right," and why might lenders be cautious about granting unlimited cure rights?

3.  **Debt Restructuring:**
    *   Why would creditors ever agree to a "haircut" on their principal or a debt-for-equity swap, rather than simply forcing a company into liquidation?
    *   What are the key advantages of an out-of-court workout compared to a formal Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the company? For the creditors?

4.  **Distressed Debt & Chapter 11:**
    *   From a creditor's perspective, what is the most important piece of analysis when a company is already in distress? (Hint: think about what you ultimately want to know).
    *   What is the "automatic stay" in Chapter 11, and why is it significant for both debtors and creditors?
    *   What is a "fulcrum security" and why is it important in a Chapter 11 reorganization?

**Further Reflection:**
*   Debt structuring and restructuring often involve significant negotiation. What skills, beyond financial analysis, do you think are important for professionals involved in these processes?
*   How do macroeconomic conditions (e.g., interest rate environment, economic growth, credit market liquidity) influence debt structuring trends and the likelihood of restructurings?
*   Consider a company that has successfully emerged from a Chapter 11 restructuring. What would you look for as a credit analyst to determine if its *new* capital structure is sustainable?
