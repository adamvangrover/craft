# Quiz: Module 5 - Future of Risk and AI

**Instructions:** Choose the best answer for each question.

**Question 1:**
Which of the following is a primary advantage of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in credit risk management?
A) AI models are inherently free from biases.
B) AI can identify complex patterns in large datasets that humans might miss.
C) AI completely eliminates the need for human oversight in credit decisions.
D) AI models require significantly less data than traditional statistical models.

**Question 2:**
"Explainable AI" (XAI) is important in credit risk management because:
A) It allows AI models to operate without any human intervention.
B) It helps regulators and analysts understand how AI models arrive at their decisions, ensuring transparency and fairness.
C) It guarantees that AI models will always make profitable credit decisions.
D) It focuses solely on the accuracy of the AI model, regardless of its complexity.

**Question 3:**
Which type of AI-related risk involves the potential for AI models to produce discriminatory outcomes against certain groups, even if unintentional?
A) Algorithmic bias
B) Cybersecurity risk
C) Model decay
D) Data privacy risk

**Question 4:**
The use of AI and machine learning for early warning systems in credit monitoring primarily aims to:
A) Replace all human credit analysts.
B) Provide more timely and proactive identification of deteriorating credit quality.
C) Set interest rates for new loan originations.
D) Automate the entire loan underwriting process for large corporate loans.

**Question 5:**
"Model decay" in the context of AI credit risk models refers to:
A) The physical degradation of the hardware running the AI model.
B) The AI model becoming less accurate over time as the underlying data patterns and economic environment change.
C) A sudden catastrophic failure of the AI model due to a software bug.
D) The process of intentionally simplifying an AI model to make it more explainable.

**Question 6:**
Which of the following is a significant ethical consideration when implementing AI in credit risk assessment?
A) Ensuring the AI uses the most advanced algorithms available, regardless of computational cost.
B) Maximizing the speed of credit decisions above all other factors.
C) Protecting sensitive customer data used to train and operate AI models.
D) The cost of acquiring AI software and tools.

**Question 7:**
One of the challenges of using AI for assessing the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) compared to large corporations is often:
A) The greater availability of standardized financial data for SMEs.
B) The simpler business models of SMEs.
C) The lack of sufficient historical data and more idiosyncratic nature of SMEs.
D) The lower regulatory scrutiny for SME lending.

**Question 8:**
How can AI potentially enhance the analysis of qualitative data (e.g., news sentiment, management discussion and analysis) in credit risk?
A) By converting all qualitative data into simple numerical scores, removing all nuances.
B) By using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify trends, sentiment, and key risk factors from text-based sources.
C) AI cannot process or analyze qualitative data effectively.
D) By exclusively focusing on quantitative financial ratios and ignoring qualitative aspects.

**Question 9:**
The "black box" nature of some complex AI models, like deep learning networks, can be a concern in credit risk because:
A) It makes them highly resistant to cyberattacks.
B) It simplifies the process of regulatory approval.
C) It can be difficult to understand the specific reasons behind a particular credit decision, challenging model validation and accountability.
D) It means these models can only be trained on very small datasets.

**Question 10:**
A key role for human credit analysts in an AI-driven future of risk management will likely be:
A) Manually inputting all data into AI systems.
B) Focusing on model validation, interpreting complex outputs, managing exceptions, and applying judgment to nuanced cases.
C) Designing and coding all AI algorithms from scratch.
D) Phasing out their roles as AI becomes fully autonomous.
