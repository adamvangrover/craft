# Agent Instructions - CRAFT Module 05: Future of Risk Management

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this specific module directory.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain CRAFT program style. This module is forward-looking, so tone can be slightly more speculative but grounded in current trends.
*   **Clarity:** Explain complex topics like AI, ML, NLP, RAG, and XAI in terms accessible to financial analysts.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Use Markdown effectively.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure descriptions of technologies and their applications are conceptually accurate and reflect current understanding.
*   **File Naming:** Follow existing conventions (e.g., `11-future-of-risk-and-ai.md`).
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Link to glossaries and relevant Fintech or Risk Management main sections.
*   **Updating Navigation:**
    *   Module navigation is via `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/modules/05-future-of-risk-management/index.html`. Update its `filesInDir` and `subDirsInfo` if content files change.
    *   The main CRAFT Hub also links here.
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 05 - Future of Risk Management

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`05-future-of-risk-management/`) explores the impact of AI and emerging technologies on credit risk management.

The main guide is `README.md`. Content is detailed in:
*   `11-future-of-risk-and-ai.md` (and its `learning-materials.md`)
An interactive HTML page `copilot.html` also exists here.
Case studies and quizzes are in their respective subdirectories.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** `11-future-of-risk-and-ai.md` is central. `copilot.html` is a significant interactive piece.
*   **Case Studies:** Focus on AI adoption, skill evolution, and GenAI terms.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Keep content conceptually current with AI trends in finance.
    *   Emphasize the "human-in-the-loop" model and the evolving role of the analyst.
    *   The `copilot.html` page is a good example of rich, interactive content; consider if other concepts in this module could benefit from similar treatment if tools allow.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Balance Hype and Reality:** Present AI's potential realistically, including challenges like bias, explainability, and model risk.
*   **Explain Key AI Concepts:** Define ML, NLP, GenAI, RAG, XAI simply.
*   **Practical Implications:** Focus on how these technologies change the day-to-day work of a credit analyst and the operations of financial institutions.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** This is a crucial component of discussing AI.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link AI/ML terms to the local CRAFT `GLOSSARY.md`, the `case-studies/Glossary_GenAI_Credit_Terms.md`, and the `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Connect to the `/Fintech/AI_in_Finance.md` for broader Fintech context.
*   Link discussions of model risk to the main `/Risk_Management/` section.
*   The `copilot.html` should be prominently linked from the module `README.md`.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   More case studies on diverse AI implementations.
*   Interactive AI demonstrators (conceptual).
*   Deeper dives into XAI techniques.
*   Updates to reflect major new AI developments.
