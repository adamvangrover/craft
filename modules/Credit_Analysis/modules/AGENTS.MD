# Agent Instructions

This directory contains the training modules for the Corporate Credit Risk Analyst Training program. Each module is in its own directory and contains a `README.md` file that provides an overview of the module.

When adding new modules, please follow the existing structure and conventions. Create a new directory for the module, and add a `README.md` file with a clear and concise overview of the module.
