## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 07 - Communication Skills

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`07-communication-skills/`) covers advanced communication topics:
1.  **Advanced Business Writing:** Focusing on persuasion and narrative in credit memos (Lesson 15).
2.  **Negotiation & Communication Skills:** For internal and external interactions (Lesson 17).

The main guide is `README.md`. Content is in `15-*.md` and `17-*.md` files, including specific `learning-materials.md`, `developer-notes.md`, and `teacher-notes.md` for each lesson. Quizzes are in `quizzes/`.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** The `15-*.md` and `17-*.md` files.
*   **Notes Files:** Ensure `developer-notes.md` and `teacher-notes.md` offer distinct, valuable insights for their respective audiences.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Provide actionable frameworks and techniques.
    *   Use examples relevant to a credit analyst's role (e.g., structuring a persuasive argument for a credit committee, preparing for a discussion with a relationship manager about a risky credit).

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Advanced Writing (Lesson 15):** Go beyond grammar. Focus on argumentation, structuring for impact, addressing counterarguments, and tailoring messages.
*   **Negotiation (Lesson 17):** Explain core concepts like BATNA, ZOPA clearly. Provide simple frameworks for preparation and execution. Differentiate internal vs. external negotiation contexts for analysts.
*   **Practical Scenarios:** Use mini-scenarios or examples to illustrate points in both lessons.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link to Module 3 (Analyst's Craft - basic writing and narrative) and Module 5 (Business Writing in earlier structure if distinct).
*   Link heavily to `/Professional_Development/` for broader soft skills like `Effective_Communication_for_Analysts.md` and `Negotiation_Skills_for_Analysts.md` (ensure CRAFT content is more tailored/advanced or provides specific credit context).
*   Ethical considerations in communication/negotiation can link to CFA Ethics or Module 9/18 (Regulatory/Ethics).

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   Interactive scenarios for negotiation or writing.
*   Video examples.
*   More case studies requiring persuasive memo writing or negotiation strategy.
