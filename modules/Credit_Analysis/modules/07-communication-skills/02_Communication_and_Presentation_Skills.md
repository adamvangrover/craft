# 5.2 Communication & Presentation Skills

This final sub-module prepares the analyst for the critical task of presenting and defending their analysis to decision-makers, such as a loan committee. It focuses on tailoring the message to the audience, presenting data effectively, and confidently handling questions and challenges.

## Learning Objectives

- Structure and deliver a clear, concise, and persuasive credit recommendation to a committee.
- Adapt communication style and content for different audiences (e.g., senior credit officers vs. relationship managers).
- Use data visualization and storytelling techniques to make complex financial information understandable and impactful.
- Apply a structured approach to confidently defend an analytical viewpoint and respond to challenging questions.

## Key Concepts Outline

### Presenting a Credit Recommendation to a Committee
The goal is to provide the committee with the information and analysis they need to make an informed decision efficiently.149

**Structure of the Presentation:**
1.  **Start with the Recommendation:** Lead with the request and your recommendation. Don't bury the lead.99
2.  **Tell the Story:** Briefly provide the background of the borrower and the transaction. Focus on the narrative, not just a list of facts.149
3.  **Focus on the Key Issues:** Highlight the 2-3 key strengths and the 2-3 key risks and their mitigants. This is the core of the discussion.
4.  **Be Prepared for Questions:** Have a deep understanding of the details, even if they are not in the main presentation.150

### Adapting Communication to Different Audiences
A credit committee may include members with different backgrounds and priorities (e.g., Chief Credit Officer, senior lenders, workout specialists).151
The presentation must be tailored to the audience. Senior decision-makers care about the high-level thesis and key risks. Other analysts may want to dig into the details of the financial model.103
Avoid overly technical jargon. Explain complex concepts in simple, direct language.152

### Defending an Analytical Viewpoint
Challenging questions are a sign of engagement, not failure. They are an opportunity to demonstrate expertise and conviction.154

**The FRAME Technique for Responding to Challenges 154:**
- **F - Focus** on the question, not the tone. Remain calm and professional.
- **R - Reflect** the concern back to ensure you understand it ("So, if I understand correctly, you're concerned about the sustainability of the revenue growth...").
- **A - Acknowledge** the business context. Show you understand why it's a valid concern ("That's a fair question, especially given the recent volatility in the industry.").
- **M - Map** your insight to their concern. Bring the discussion back to your evidence-based analysis ("Our analysis of their long-term contracts, which we detail on page 5, provides comfort on that point...").
- **E - Explain** the impact or trade-off. Be transparent about risks and how they are being managed.

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

A role-playing exercise. Trainees are divided into groups. One trainee in each group is tasked with presenting their credit recommendation from the "StableCo" credit memo (from Module 3.2) to the rest of the group, who will act as the loan committee. The committee members are given roles (e.g., "skeptical credit officer," "relationship-focused manager") and a list of challenging questions to ask. The presenter has 10 minutes to make their case and 10 minutes for Q&A.

### Assessment Method

Peer and instructor feedback on the role-playing exercise. The presenter will be evaluated on their clarity, persuasiveness, ability to focus on key issues, and effectiveness in responding to questions using a structured approach like FRAME. The committee members will be evaluated on the quality and relevance of their questions.
