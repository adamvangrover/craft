# 1.3 Financial Statement Analysis (FSA) for Creditors

This sub-module hones the analyst's skills in quantitative analysis, specifically through the lens of a creditor. It emphasizes that for a lender, the ultimate purpose of ratio analysis is not just to describe a company's performance but to assess its capacity for debt repayment and its resilience to financial stress.

## Learning Objectives

- Differentiate between the objectives of credit analysis (downside risk mitigation) and equity analysis (upside potential).
- Calculate and interpret the four key categories of financial ratios: Liquidity, Solvency/Leverage, Coverage, and Profitability.
- Apply trend analysis and common-size statement analysis to identify patterns and structural changes in a company's financial performance.
- Synthesize ratio analysis, trend analysis, and peer comparisons to form a coherent credit narrative and identify key financial red flags.

## Key Concepts Outline

### Adopting the Creditor's Lens
Unlike equity investors who focus on growth and future stock appreciation, credit analysts are primarily concerned with downside risk, capital preservation, and the certainty of repayment.4
The central questions are: 1) Can the borrower service its debt obligations from cash flow? 2) In a worst-case scenario, is there sufficient collateral value to recover the principal?

### A Structured Framework for Ratio Analysis
Ratio analysis is the process of using financial statement data to calculate statistical relationships that provide insights into a company's performance and financial health.18 A single ratio is a snapshot, but its true power comes from comparison over time and against peers.39

- **Liquidity Ratios:** Measure the ability to meet short-term obligations (due within one year). A primary concern for lenders, as a liquidity crisis can lead to default even in a profitable company.38
  - **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
  - **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test):** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- **Solvency/Leverage Ratios:** Measure the extent to which a company relies on debt to finance its assets and its ability to meet long-term obligations. High leverage amplifies risk.38
  - **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets
  - **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
  - **Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio:** Total Debt / EBITDA (A key covenant metric)
- **Coverage Ratios:** Directly assess the ability of a company's earnings or cash flow to cover its interest and principal payments. These are among the most critical ratios for credit analysis.38
  - **Interest Coverage Ratio:** EBIT / Interest Expense
  - **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** A measure of cash flow available to pay current debt obligations. A common formulation is (EBITDA - Maintenance CapEx) / (Total Debt Service).
- **Profitability Ratios:** Measure the company's ability to generate profits from its sales and assets. Profit is the ultimate source of cash flow and repayment capacity.38
  - **Gross Profit Margin:** Gross Profit / Revenue
  - **EBITDA Margin:** EBITDA / Revenue
  - **Net Profit Margin:** Net Income / Revenue
  - **Return on Assets (ROA):** Net Income / Total Assets
  - **Return on Equity (ROE):** Net Income / Total Equity

### DuPont Analysis: Deconstructing ROE
DuPont analysis breaks down ROE into three components to provide deeper insight into performance drivers: ROE = (Net Profit Margin) × (Asset Turnover) × (Equity Multiplier).39
This framework allows an analyst to determine if high ROE is driven by strong profitability, efficient asset use, or high financial leverage—the latter being a potential source of risk.

### Dynamic Analysis Techniques
- **Trend Analysis (Horizontal Analysis):** Evaluating ratio performance over several periods (e.g., 3-5 years) to identify the direction and magnitude of change. An improving trend provides comfort, while a deteriorating trend is a significant warning sign.18
- **Common-Size Analysis (Vertical Analysis):** Expressing all income statement items as a percentage of revenue and all balance sheet items as a percentage of total assets. This facilitates comparison between companies of different sizes and highlights changes in business strategy or cost structure.18

### Synthesizing the Analysis: Identifying Red Flags
The goal is to integrate all quantitative analysis to spot signs of financial distress or accounting manipulation.28 Key red flags include:
- Divergence of Cash Flow and Profit: Net income is positive and growing, but cash flow from operations is weak or negative. This may suggest aggressive revenue recognition or poor working capital management.28
- Declining Margins: Consistent erosion of gross or operating margins compared to peers can signal intense competition or operational inefficiencies.36
- Rising Leverage: A steady increase in debt-to-equity or debt-to-EBITDA ratios without a corresponding increase in profitability indicates rising financial risk.36
- Unusual Inventory Growth: Inventory growing much faster than sales can indicate obsolete products or sales challenges.36

### Table 1: Key Financial Ratios for Credit Analysis

| Ratio Category     | Ratio Name             | Formula                                       | Interpretation (What it measures)                                 | Creditor's Perspective (Why it matters for repayment risk)                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Liquidity**      | Current Ratio          | Current Assets / Current Liabilities          | Ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets.   | A ratio below 1.0x signals a potential inability to meet immediate obligations, like interest payments or maturing debt.     |
|                    | Quick Ratio            | (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities | A stricter measure of liquidity, excluding less-liquid inventory. | Shows if the company can meet short-term obligations without relying on selling inventory, which can be difficult in a downturn. |
| **Solvency/Leverage** | Debt-to-Assets         | Total Debt / Total Assets                     | The percentage of a company's assets financed through debt.       | A high ratio indicates high leverage and greater risk to creditors in a liquidation scenario, as there are fewer assets per dollar of debt. |
|                    | Debt-to-Equity         | Total Debt / Total Equity                     | The proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing.    | Measures the company's reliance on borrowed funds versus owner's capital. A high ratio signifies a smaller equity cushion to absorb losses. |
|                    | Debt-to-EBITDA         | Total Debt / EBITDA                           | How many years it would take to repay total debt from EBITDA.     | A primary covenant metric. A high or rising ratio indicates an elevated debt burden relative to cash-generating ability.       |
| **Coverage**       | Interest Coverage      | EBIT / Interest Expense                       | Ability of operating earnings to cover interest payments.         | A low ratio (e.g., < 2.0x) is a major red flag, indicating a thin margin of safety for making interest payments.              |
|                    | Debt Service Coverage  | (EBITDA - CapEx) / (Principal + Interest Payments) | Ability of operational cash flow to cover all debt service.       | The most direct measure of repayment capacity. A ratio below 1.0x means the company is not generating enough cash to service its debt. |
| **Profitability**  | EBITDA Margin          | EBITDA / Revenue                              | A proxy for operating cash flow profitability before capital structure impacts. | Shows the fundamental profitability of the core business. Stable or expanding margins are positive signs for future cash flow generation. |
|                    | Return on Assets (ROA) | Net Income / Total Assets                     | Efficiency in using assets to generate profit.                    | A declining ROA may indicate inefficient asset management or deteriorating profitability, impacting long-term viability.       |

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Trainees are given three years of financial statements for two companies in the same industry: "StableCo" and "GrowthCo." They are required to build an Excel spreadsheet to calculate the key ratios from Table 1 for both companies for all three years. They must then write a one-page memo comparing the two companies, highlighting trends, and concluding which company represents a lower credit risk and why, justifying their conclusion with specific ratio analysis.

### Assessment Method

Review of the submitted Excel model for accuracy of calculations and the written memo for the quality of analysis, clarity of argument, and ability to synthesize data into a coherent credit recommendation.
