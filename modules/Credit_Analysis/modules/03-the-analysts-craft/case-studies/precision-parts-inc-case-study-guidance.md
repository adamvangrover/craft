**Case Study Recap:**
PPI, a private manufacturer of specialized metal components for aerospace and industrial machinery, seeks a $15M Term Loan (for new machinery and debt refinancing) and a $5M Revolver.

**1. Preliminary Financial Analysis:**

*   **Historical (2022A):**
    *   EBITDA = $7,000k
    *   Total Debt = $9,500k
    *   **Total Debt / EBITDA = $9,500k / $7,000k = 1.36x**
    *   Interest Expense = $600k
    *   **Interest Coverage (EBITDA/Interest) = $7,000k / $600k = 11.67x**

*   **Projected (2024F Base Case - Post Financing):**
    *   Projected EBITDA = $8,500k
    *   Pro Forma Total Debt = $24,000k
    *   **Pro Forma Total Debt / EBITDA = $24,000k / $8,500k = 2.82x**
    *   Estimated 2024F Interest Expense:
        *   Assume existing $4M seller note @ 6% = $240k
        *   New $15M Term Loan @ (SOFR 5% + 4.5%) = 9.5% = $1,425k
        *   (For simplicity, ignore interest on any refinanced portion of old $5M term loan for this estimate, or assume it's part of the $15M new loan. A full model would be more precise).
        *   Total Estimated Interest ~ $1,665k
    *   **Pro Forma Interest Coverage (EBITDA/Interest) = $8,500k / $1,665k = 5.10x**

*   **Brief Comments on Leverage and Coverage:**
    *   **Leverage:** Historically, PPI has maintained very low leverage (1.36x in 2022A). The proposed transaction significantly increases leverage to 2.82x on a pro forma basis for 2024F. While this is a large jump, a sub-3.0x leverage ratio for a niche manufacturer might still be considered moderate, depending on industry norms and cash flow stability. The key will be the ability to de-lever through projected EBITDA growth and debt repayment.
    *   **Coverage:** Historically, interest coverage was exceptionally strong (11.67x). Pro forma coverage (around 5.10x) is still solid and suggests a good ability to meet interest payments, assuming projections are met. The significant decrease highlights the impact of the new debt burden.

**2. Industry & Competitive Position (Qualitative):**

*   **Porter's Five Forces - Key Impacts on PPI:**
    *   **Bargaining Power of Buyers:** Likely **High**, especially from key aerospace customers who might be large and sophisticated. This could pressure PPI's margins or payment terms. The contract renewal for a major customer (20% of revenue) is a specific manifestation of this.
    *   **Threat of New Entrants:** Possibly **Medium**. While PPI has a reputation for quality and custom work (which creates some barrier), new CNC machinery is becoming more accessible, potentially lowering barriers for some types of component manufacturing. However, aerospace qualification can be a significant barrier.
    *   **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:** The case doesn't detail this, but specialized component manufacturing can be fragmented or have niche players. PPI's "reputation for high-quality, custom-engineered parts" suggests some differentiation.
    *   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** Rising raw material costs in 2023 suggest this could be **Medium to High** for key inputs.
    *   **Threat of Substitutes:** Depends on the specific components. For highly specialized parts, substitutes might be limited. For more commoditized components, the threat could be higher.
*   **PPI's Apparent Competitive Advantage:**
    *   Reputation for high-quality, custom-engineered parts.
    *   Strong customer relationships (though concentrated).
    *   Specialized manufacturing expertise.

**3. Key Credit Strengths for PPI:**

*   **1. Established Reputation & Niche Expertise:** 20 years in operation with a reputation for high-quality, custom-engineered parts provides some defensible market position and customer loyalty.
*   **2. Historically Strong Profitability & Cash Flow:** Demonstrated good EBITDA margins and very strong interest coverage historically, indicating operational effectiveness and ability to generate cash prior to this expansion.
*   **3. Strategic Investment for Growth & Efficiency:** The new machinery is intended to increase capacity and improve efficiency (COGS reduction), which could drive future EBITDA growth and de-leveraging if executed well.
*   **4. Diversification (albeit limited):** Serves two distinct sectors (aerospace and industrial machinery), which might offer some protection if one sector experiences a downturn, though aerospace is dominant.

**4. Key Credit Risks for PPI:**

*   **1. Significant Increase in Leverage:** Pro forma Debt/EBITDA jumps from ~1.4x to ~2.8x. This reduces financial flexibility and cushion to absorb shocks. The absolute debt quantum also increases substantially.
*   **2. Customer Concentration & Contract Renewal Risk:** Key aerospace customers account for ~50% of revenue, with one major contract (20% of revenue) up for renewal in 18 months. Loss or adverse re-negotiation of this contract would severely impact financials.
*   **3. Execution Risk with Expansion & Machinery Integration:** Realizing the expected 25% capacity increase and 1-2% COGS reduction from new machinery involves operational execution risk (installation, training, achieving efficiencies). Projections are dependent on this success.
*   **4. Management Succession Risk:** The founder/CEO nearing retirement without a clear succession plan introduces uncertainty regarding future leadership, strategy, and potentially customer/employee relationships.
*   **5. Cyclicality & Margin Pressure:** Exposure to cyclical industrial machinery sector and recent margin pressure from raw material costs highlight vulnerability to external factors.

**5. Propose Potential Mitigants:**

*   **1. For Increased Leverage:**
    *   **Loan Structure:** Include scheduled amortization in the term loan to ensure gradual de-leveraging. Consider a cash flow sweep mechanism to accelerate debt repayment if PPI outperforms projections.
    *   **Covenants:** Implement financial covenants (e.g., Maximum Total Debt/EBITDA, Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) set with reasonable cushion to projections, providing early warning signals.
*   **2. For Customer Concentration & Contract Renewal:**
    *   **Lender Due Diligence:** Lender to gain comfort with the strength and longevity of key customer relationships. Understand PPI's strategy for contract renewal.
    *   **Company Action:** PPI to actively work on diversifying its customer base over time.
    *   **Reporting Covenant:** Require PPI to promptly notify lenders of any material changes to key customer contracts.
*   **3. For Execution Risk (New Machinery):**
    *   **Phased Disbursement:** Potentially structure loan disbursements tied to milestones in machinery acquisition and commissioning.
    *   **Management Attestation:** Management to provide detailed plan and track record for similar capital projects.
    *   **Contingency in Projections:** Ensure projections (or lender's downside case) build in some buffer for potential delays or lower-than-expected efficiency gains initially.
*   **4. For Management Succession Risk:**
    *   **Lender Discussion:** Discuss succession plans with the CEO/owners. Understand if internal candidates are being developed or if an external search is planned.
    *   **Key Person Insurance:** Could be considered, though less common for retirement if planned. More relevant for unexpected loss.
    *   **Management Retention Plan:** If there's a strong second tier of management, ensure they are incentivized to stay post-CEO retirement.
*   **5. For Cyclicality & Margin Pressure:**
    *   **Stress Testing:** Lender to run downside scenarios in their model reflecting potential cyclical downturns or continued margin pressure.
    *   **Liquidity Covenant:** A minimum liquidity or availability covenant (if revolver is significant) could be considered.
    *   **Company Action:** PPI to focus on cost control and explore pass-through mechanisms for raw material costs if possible.

**6. Formulate a Credit Narrative & Recommendation (Executive Summary Format):**

**(This is an illustrative example; students' approaches and recommendations may vary.)**

**Executive Summary: Precision Parts Inc. (PPI) - $15MM Term Loan & $5MM Revolver Request**

**Recommendation:** Approve the requested $15 million Term Loan and $5 million Revolving Credit Facility for Precision Parts Inc. (PPI), subject to the proposed terms and financial covenants outlined below.
