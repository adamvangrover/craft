# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 5 - Business Writing & Grammar for Credit Professionals

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 5)

*   **Credit Memorandum (Credit Memo/Report/Application):** A formal document prepared by a credit analyst that summarizes the credit analysis of a borrower, details the proposed transaction, highlights key risks and mitigants, and provides a recommendation to decision-makers.
*   **Executive Summary:** A concise overview (typically one page or less) at the beginning of a credit memo, stating the recommendation and summarizing the key aspects of the credit proposal. Often the most read section.
*   **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** A communication principle emphasizing that the main point or conclusion should be stated at the beginning of a document or section.
*   **Active Voice:** A sentence structure where the subject performs the action of the verb (e.g., "The company increased revenue."). Generally preferred in business writing for clarity and directness.
*   **Passive Voice:** A sentence structure where the subject receives the action of the verb (e.g., "Revenue was increased by the company."). Can be less direct and wordier.
*   **Conciseness:** Expressing ideas clearly with no unnecessary words; brevity.
*   **Clarity:** Writing that is easy to understand, unambiguous, and free from jargon where possible.
*   **Jargon:** Specialized terms or expressions used by a particular profession or group that can be difficult for others to understand. Should be defined if used, or plain language preferred.

*   **Nominalization:** A noun formed from a verb or adjective (e.g., "investigation" from "investigate"; "assessment" from "assess"). Overuse can make writing abstract and wordy.

*   **Grammar:** The system and structure of a language, including rules for syntax and word forms.
*   **Punctuation:** The marks, such as period, comma, and semicolon, used in writing to separate sentences and their elements and to clarify meaning.
