# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 6 - Critical Thinking & Forming a Narrative

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 6)

*   **Critical Thinking:** The objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment. Involves conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information.
*   **Objectivity:** The ability to consider or represent facts, information, etc., without being influenced by personal feelings or opinions.
*   **Healthy Skepticism:** A questioning attitude towards information or claims, without being overly cynical; a desire to seek evidence and verify.
*   **Assumption:** Something that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof. Critical thinking involves identifying and challenging assumptions.
*   **Hypothesis:** A supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.
*   **Key Performance Drivers:** Fundamental factors (internal or external) that significantly influence a company's success, profitability, and cash flow generation.
*   **Key Credit Risks:** Significant threats or vulnerabilities (financial, business, industry, event-specific) that could impair a company's ability to service its debt.
*   **Mitigants:** Factors, structural protections, or company strengths that reduce the probability of a risk occurring or lessen its potential impact.
*   **Cognitive Bias:** A systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own "subjective reality" from their perception of the input.
    *   **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's preexisting beliefs.
    *   **Anchoring Bias:** Over-reliance on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions.
    *   **Availability Heuristic:** Overestimating the likelihood of events that are easily recalled in memory.
    *   **Bandwagon Effect (Groupthink):** The tendency to align one's thinking with that of a group.
    *   **Halo/Horn Effect:** Allowing one positive (halo) or negative (horn) trait to disproportionately influence overall judgment.
    *   **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing a behavior or endeavor due to previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if it's no longer the rational decision.
    *   **Narrative Fallacy:** The tendency to create or believe coherent (but often oversimplified or inaccurate) stories to explain complex events.
*   **Credit Narrative:** The coherent story or argument constructed by an analyst that synthesizes quantitative and qualitative findings to justify a credit recommendation.
*   **Thesis (Credit Thesis):** The central argument or main point that the credit narrative aims to support regarding the creditworthiness of a borrower and the proposed transaction.
*   **Synthesis:** Combining various components or elements to form a connected, coherent whole. In credit analysis, synthesizing diverse data points into a meaningful narrative.

## Conceptual Tools & Frameworks (Beyond this Module's Content)

*   **Issue Trees / Logic Trees:** A structured way to break down a complex problem or question into smaller, more manageable components. Useful for ensuring all relevant aspects are considered in an analysis.
*   **MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive):** A grouping principle stating that items should be divided into subsets that do not overlap (mutually exclusive) and that together cover all possibilities (collectively exhaustive). Useful for structuring analysis and arguments.
*   **Pre-Mortem Analysis:** A technique where, before making a decision (e.g., approving a loan), the team imagines that the decision has already been made and has failed spectacularly. They then work backward to identify all the possible reasons for this failure. Helps uncover potential risks and blind spots.
*   **Red Teaming:** Assigning a group to actively challenge a plan or analysis from an adversarial perspective to identify weaknesses.

*(Note: Developing strong critical thinking is an ongoing process of learning, practice, and self-reflection.)*
