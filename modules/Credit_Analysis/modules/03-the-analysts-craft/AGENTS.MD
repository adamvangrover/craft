## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 03 - The Analyst's Craft

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`03-the-analysts-craft/`) covers:
1.  **Business Writing & Grammar:** Focusing on credit memorandums, clarity, conciseness, conviction, and professionalism.
2.  **Critical Thinking & Forming a Narrative:** Frameworks for critical thinking, identifying key drivers/risks/mitigants, and synthesizing data into a compelling credit story.

The main guide for this module is `README.md`. Content is detailed in:
*   `05-business-writing-and-grammar.md` (and its `learning-materials.md`)
*   `06-critical-thinking-and-forming-a-narrative.md` (and its `learning-materials.md`)
Case studies are in the `case-studies/` subdirectory.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** The `05-*.md` and `06-*.md` files.
*   **Learning Materials:** `*-learning-materials.md` files for glossaries/links.
*   **Case Studies:** The `case-studies/` subdirectory. `precision-parts-inc-case-study-guidance.md` exists; the actual case might need creation or be integrated.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Provide clear, actionable advice. For writing, use examples of good vs. poor phrasing. For critical thinking, use mini-scenarios.
    *   Ensure the link between critical thinking and effective communication (the credit narrative) is strong.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Business Writing:** Emphasize the structure of a credit memo. Provide practical tips for improving clarity (e.g., active voice, BLUF).
*   **Critical Thinking:** Explain frameworks simply. Focus on how to apply them in a credit analysis context (e.g., questioning assumptions in management projections).
*   **Forming a Narrative:** This is a key skill. Explain how to build a logical argument from disparate pieces of information.
*   **Practical Exercises:** The case study component is important for applying these "softer" but critical skills.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link writing concepts to `/Professional_Development/Effective_Communication_for_Analysts.md`.
*   Link critical thinking concepts to `/Professional_Development/Critical_Thinking_in_Financial_Analysis.md` and potentially `/Behavioral_Finance/` for cognitive biases.
*   Reference later CRAFT modules (e.g., Module 15: Advanced Business Writing) for more advanced discussions.

Refer to parent `AGENTS.MD` files for broader CRAFT program and repository guidelines.
