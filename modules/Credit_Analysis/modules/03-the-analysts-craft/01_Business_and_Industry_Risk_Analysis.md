# 2.2 Business & Industry Risk Analysis

This sub-module equips analysts with qualitative frameworks to assess the risks that are not immediately apparent in the financial statements. The focus is on understanding the competitive landscape, the company's strategic positioning within that landscape, and the quality of its management.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply Porter's Five Forces framework to analyze the competitive intensity and profitability of an industry.
- Conduct a SWOT analysis to identify a company's key internal Strengths and Weaknesses and external Opportunities and Threats.
- Analyze an industry's cyclicality and identify its primary growth drivers to understand its sensitivity to the business cycle.
- Assess a company's competitive position (e.g., market leader, niche player) and the credibility of its management strategy.

## Key Concepts Outline

### Industry Analysis: Porter's Five Forces
A framework for understanding the forces that shape competition within an industry, which ultimately determine its attractiveness and average profitability.64

**The Five Forces 65:**
1.  **Threat of New Entrants:** How easy is it for new competitors to enter the market? High barriers to entry (e.g., high capital requirements, strong brand loyalty, patents) protect existing firms and are favorable for credit quality.65
2.  **Bargaining Power of Buyers:** How much power do customers have to drive down prices? Power is high when buyers are concentrated, products are undifferentiated, and switching costs are low.64
3.  **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** How much power do suppliers have to raise input prices? Power is high when suppliers are concentrated, the input is critical, and there are no substitutes.64
4.  **Threat of Substitute Products or Services:** How likely is it that customers will switch to a different type of product or service that meets the same basic need? (e.g., video conferencing as a substitute for air travel).64
5.  **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:** How intense is the competition between existing firms? Rivalry is high when there are many competitors of similar size, industry growth is slow, and products are commodities.66

**Credit Perspective:** Industries with strong competitive forces (e.g., high rivalry, low barriers to entry) tend to have lower, more volatile profitability, which translates to higher credit risk.

### Company-Specific Analysis: SWOT Framework
A strategic planning tool that helps organize an assessment of a company's internal and external factors.68 It is a useful framework for summarizing qualitative findings in a credit memo.69

- **Internal Factors:**
  - **Strengths:** Internal attributes that give the company a competitive advantage (e.g., strong brand, proprietary technology, efficient operations).69
  - **Weaknesses:** Internal attributes that place the company at a disadvantage (e.g., outdated technology, high cost structure, inexperienced management).69
- **External Factors:**
  - **Opportunities:** External factors the company could exploit to its advantage (e.g., new markets, favorable regulatory changes, changing consumer tastes).69
  - **Threats:** External factors that could harm the company (e.g., economic downturn, new competitors, technological disruption).69

**Credit Perspective:** The analysis helps identify key risks (from Weaknesses and Threats) and potential mitigants (from Strengths and Opportunities).71

### Analyzing Industry Cyclicality and Growth Drivers
- **Cyclical vs. Non-Cyclical Industries:**
  - **Cyclical Industries:** Highly sensitive to the business cycle. Revenues are strong during economic expansions but fall sharply during recessions (e.g., automotive, airlines, construction).45 These industries carry higher inherent credit risk.
  - **Non-Cyclical (Defensive) Industries:** Relatively stable performance regardless of the economic cycle, as they provide essential goods and services (e.g., utilities, healthcare, consumer staples).45 These industries carry lower inherent credit risk.
- **Identifying Growth Drivers:** Understanding what fuels an industry's growth (e.g., population growth, technological innovation, regulatory changes) is key to forecasting its future prospects.72

### Assessing Competitive Position and Management Strategy
- **Competitive Position:** Is the company a market leader with significant scale and pricing power, a niche player with a defensible position, or a weak competitor with no clear advantage?.10
- **Management Assessment:** A qualitative but critical evaluation of the management team's experience, track record, and strategic credibility. Analysts assess management's ability to formulate and execute a sound business strategy.10

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Trainees are assigned an industry (e.g., the U.S. airline industry). They are required to use publicly available information (e.g., industry reports, news articles) to conduct a Porter's Five Forces analysis. They must write a one-page summary evaluating the overall attractiveness of the industry from a creditor's perspective, concluding whether it is a high-risk or low-risk industry to lend to and why.

### Assessment Method

Evaluation of the submitted Porter's Five Forces analysis. The assessment will focus on the trainee's ability to identify the key drivers for each force, use evidence to support their analysis, and draw a logical conclusion about the industry's inherent credit risk.
