> **Buy-Side Perspective:** For a credit investor, due diligence is not just a compliance exercise; it is the primary defense against capital impairment. We are not looking for reasons to say "yes"—that's the banker's job. We are looking for the one reason to say "no" that isn't immediately obvious. A missed lawsuit in the footnotes or a misunderstood covenant definition can be the difference between par recovery and a distressed exit.

# 3.1 Due Diligence & Information Gathering

This sub-module focuses on the systematic process of collecting and verifying the information necessary to conduct a thorough credit analysis. It covers primary documents, public filings, and the critical process of preparing for and engaging with company management.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop and utilize a comprehensive due diligence checklist to systematically gather required financial, legal, and operational information.
- Analyze key sections of SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) to extract critical information on business strategy, risk factors, and financial details.
- Effectively use third-party industry reports to benchmark a company's performance and understand market trends.
- Formulate insightful and targeted questions for management calls to probe key areas of credit risk and validate assumptions.

## Key Concepts Outline

### The Purpose of Due Diligence
Due diligence is the process of investigation and verification undertaken to confirm all material facts in a transaction.83
For a lender, its purpose is to uncover any legal or financial risks that could endanger the repayment of the loan, ensuring the lender makes an informed decision.83 It can lead to changes in loan terms, collateral, or even a decision to withdraw from the deal.83

### Creating a Due Diligence Checklist
A systematic checklist ensures no crucial aspect is overlooked.84 The level of detail depends on the complexity of the transaction.84

> **Pro Tip:** When reviewing a data room, pay more attention to what is *missing* than what is there. Management will always provide the "good" charts. If a standard schedule (like an aging of accounts receivable or a breakdown of cap-ex) is absent, assume the numbers are bad until proven otherwise.

**Key Categories for a Credit Due Diligence Checklist 85:**
- **Corporate & Legal:** Articles of incorporation, bylaws, organizational charts, shareholder lists, good standing certificates.87
- **Financial Information:** Audited financial statements (3-5 years), recent interim statements, tax returns, detailed schedules of debt, accounts receivable aging, and accounts payable aging.84
- **Assets & Collateral:** Schedules of all real estate, equipment, and inventory; copies of leases, deeds, and appraisals.85
- **Material Contracts:** Key customer contracts, supplier agreements, employment agreements for key management.84
- **Intellectual Property:** Schedule of patents, trademarks, and licenses.85
- **Litigation:** A summary of any pending or threatened legal action against the company.85

### Analyzing SEC Filings (10-K and 10-Q)
These are primary sources of detailed information for publicly traded companies, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.90 The 10-K is an annual, audited report, while the 10-Q is a quarterly, unaudited report.92

**Key Sections for Credit Analysts 90:**
- **Item 1: Business:** A detailed description of the company's operations, products, markets, and competitive landscape. Essential for understanding the business model.
- **Item 1A: Risk Factors:** Management's own assessment of the most significant risks facing the company. This is required reading for any analyst.
- **Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A):** Management's narrative explanation of the financial results. It provides context for the numbers, discusses trends, and outlines future outlook and known uncertainties. Crucial for understanding the "why" behind performance changes.
- **Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:** The audited financial statements and the all-important Notes to the Financial Statements.

### Using Industry Reports and Market Data
Utilizing reports from market research firms to understand industry size, growth trends, competitive dynamics, and profitability benchmarks.73
This provides essential context for evaluating a company's performance. A company growing at 2% may seem weak, but if its industry is shrinking by 5%, that 2% growth is a sign of strength.

### Preparing for Management Calls
The management call is an opportunity to clarify questions that arise from the document review and to assess the quality and credibility of the management team.74

**Preparation is Key:** An analyst should never go into a management call unprepared. The process involves:
1.  Thoroughly reviewing all financial and legal documents first.
2.  Identifying inconsistencies, anomalies, or areas needing further explanation.
3.  Developing a structured list of open-ended questions.

**Sample Question Areas 95:**
- **On Performance:** "Your revenues increased by 15% last year, but EBITDA margins declined by 200 basis points. Can you walk me through the key drivers of that margin compression?"
- **On Strategy:** "What are your top 2-3 strategic priorities for the next 18 months, and what are the biggest risks to achieving them?"
- **On Financial Policy:** "What is your target leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA), and how do you plan to manage the capital structure going forward?"
- **On Industry Conditions:** "How are you seeing the current competitive landscape, and how is your company positioned to handle pricing pressure from new entrants?"

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Trainees are provided with the 10-K for a company and a blank due diligence checklist template. Their task is to populate the checklist by identifying where in the 10-K each piece of requested information can be found (e.g., "Schedule of Debt Maturities - See Note 8 to the Financial Statements"). They must also draft five key questions for a hypothetical management call based on their review of the MD&A and Risk Factors sections.

### Assessment Method

Review of the completed due diligence checklist for completeness and accuracy. The quality of the management call questions will be assessed based on their relevance, specificity, and demonstrated understanding of the key credit issues facing the company as disclosed in the 10-K.

<summary><strong>Knowledge Check: Handling One-Time Gains</strong></summary>

**Scenario:** You are reviewing a potential borrower's 10-K and notice that "Other Income" has increased significantly, boosting EBITDA. Upon digging into the notes, you find it relates to a one-time gain from a property sale. How should you treat this in your credit model?

**Answer:** Exclude it. Credit analysis focuses on recurring, sustainable cash flow. One-time asset sales distort the true operating performance and debt service capacity of the business.
