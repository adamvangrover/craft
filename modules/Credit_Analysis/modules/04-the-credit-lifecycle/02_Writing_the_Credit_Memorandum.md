# 3.2 Writing the Credit Memorandum

This sub-module focuses on the crucial skill of communicating the results of the credit analysis. The credit memorandum (or credit memo) is the primary document used to present a lending recommendation to decision-makers. The emphasis is on creating a clear, concise, and persuasive narrative that logically supports a final recommendation.

## Learning Objectives

- Structure a credit memorandum logically, including all essential components from the executive summary to the final recommendation.
- Write a concise and impactful executive summary that clearly states the loan request, the credit thesis, and the key risks.
- Develop a compelling credit narrative that goes beyond simply restating financial data to explain the "so what" behind the numbers.
- Clearly articulate the primary risks in the transaction and propose specific, actionable mitigants to address those risks.

## Key Concepts Outline

### The Purpose and Function of a Credit Memorandum
The credit memo is the primary means of communication within a bank for credit decisions.98
It serves three main functions:
1.  To provide a comprehensive analysis of a customer relationship and loan request.
2.  To create a formal record of the analyst's thoughts and actions.
3.  To support a specific recommendation (approve, decline, or modify) to the loan committee.98

### Structuring a Compelling Credit Narrative
An effective credit memo tells a story. It should not be a simple regurgitation of data but a narrative that explains the borrower's history, current situation, and future prospects, all through the lens of repayment capacity.99

**Key Building Blocks of the Memo 99:**
- Executive Summary / Request
- Borrower & Management Background
- Loan Structure & Purpose
- Industry & Market Analysis
- Financial Analysis
- Collateral Analysis
- Risks & Mitigants
- Final Recommendation & Risk Rating

### Writing the Executive Summary: The "So What" Up Front
Many decision-makers will form their opinion based on the first page. The executive summary must be clear, concise, and impactful.99

**Essential Components 103:**
- **The Request:** Clearly state the borrower, the loan amount, and the purpose (e.g., "XYZ Corp. requests a $10 million term loan to finance the acquisition of ABC Company.").
- **The Credit Thesis:** In 2-3 sentences, explain the core reason why this is a good loan (e.g., "The acquisition will enhance XYZ's market position and generate significant cost synergies, leading to strong pro-forma cash flow sufficient to service the proposed debt.").
- **Key Strengths:** Bullet points highlighting the main positive factors (e.g., experienced management, strong historical performance).
- **Key Risks & Mitigants:** Bullet points identifying the primary risks and how they are addressed (e.g., "Risk: Integration of the acquisition. Mitigant: Management has a successful track record of integrating past acquisitions.").
- **Recommendation:** A clear statement of the proposed action (e.g., "Approval is recommended subject to the terms and conditions outlined herein.").

### Articulating Risks and Mitigants
This section demonstrates the analyst's critical thinking. It's not enough to list risks; one must propose concrete ways to mitigate them.101
- **Risk:** A potential future event that could impair the borrower's ability to repay (e.g., customer concentration, industry downturn, rising interest rates).
- **Mitigant:** A structural feature of the loan or a strength of the borrower that reduces the likelihood or impact of that risk (e.g., personal guarantees from owners, strong collateral coverage, financial covenants, interest rate hedges).
The analysis should focus on the 3-5 largest risks, not every conceivable risk.101

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Using the completed analysis from the "StableCo" case study (Modules 1.3 and 2.1), trainees are tasked with writing a full credit memorandum. They will be provided with a standard bank template and must populate all sections, including writing a compelling executive summary, detailing their financial analysis, and identifying at least three key risks with corresponding mitigants.

### Assessment Method

Submission of the full credit memorandum. The memo will be graded on:
- Clarity and Conciseness: Especially in the executive summary.
- Logical Flow: Does the narrative build a coherent argument?
- Depth of Analysis: Does the memo go beyond surface-level data to provide insight?
- Risk Identification: Are the key risks correctly identified and are the proposed mitigants realistic and effective?
