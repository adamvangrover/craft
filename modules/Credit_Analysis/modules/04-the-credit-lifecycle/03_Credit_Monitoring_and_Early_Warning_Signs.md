# 4.3 Credit Monitoring, Annual Reviews, and Early Warning Signs

This sub-module covers the essential post-closing responsibilities of a credit analyst. It emphasizes that credit analysis is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of monitoring, reassessment, and proactive risk management to identify and address potential problems before they lead to default.

## Learning Objectives

- Outline the key components and objectives of a formal annual credit review process for a corporate loan.
- Describe effective methods for tracking a borrower's compliance with financial covenants on a periodic basis.
- Identify a range of quantitative and qualitative early warning signs that may indicate credit deterioration.
- Explain the purpose and function of a credit watchlist in managing problem loans within a financial institution.

## Key Concepts Outline

### The Process for Annual Credit Reviews
An annual (or more frequent) review is a systematic reassessment of a borrower's creditworthiness after a loan has been funded.137
**Objectives:** To ensure the borrower's risk profile has not materially deteriorated, to confirm compliance with loan terms, and to update the internal risk rating.137

**Key Steps in the Review Process 139:**
1.  **Pre-File Review:** Gather all necessary documents, including annual and interim financial statements, compliance certificates, and reports on collateral.
2.  **File Review:**
    - Perform a full financial analysis, comparing current performance to the prior year and the original underwriting case.
    - Recalculate financial covenants to confirm compliance.
    - Re-evaluate the Five C's of Credit in light of the new information.
    - Assess the adequacy of collateral value.
3.  **Post-File Review:** Document the findings in an annual review memo, update the risk rating, and present conclusions to management.

### Tracking Covenant Compliance
Monitoring covenant compliance is a critical, ongoing task, typically performed quarterly when financial statements are received.140

**Process:**
1.  Obtain the borrower's quarterly financial statements and a signed compliance certificate.
2.  Using the precise definitions from the credit agreement, calculate the required financial ratios (e.g., Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio).
3.  Compare the calculated values to the required thresholds in the credit agreement.
4.  Document compliance or any breaches. A breach is an Event of Default and requires immediate attention and escalation.141

**Automation:** Many institutions use specialized software to automate the tracking and flagging of covenants, reducing manual error and improving efficiency.141

### Identifying Early Warning Signs (EWS) of Credit Deterioration
The goal of monitoring is to identify problems early, before a payment default occurs. Analysts must be vigilant for both quantitative and qualitative red flags.143

- **Financial Warning Signs 144:**
  - Breach of financial covenants.
  - Sustained decline in revenue or profitability.
  - Deteriorating margins compared to peers.
  - Negative or declining cash flow from operations.
  - Rapid increase in leverage.
  - Lengthening of the cash conversion cycle (e.g., rising inventory or receivables days).
  - Missed or late loan payments.
- **Non-Financial Warning Signs 144:**
  - Unexpected departure of key management (e.g., CEO or CFO).
  - Frequent changes in auditors or accounting policies.
  - Loss of a major customer or supplier.
  - Adverse industry or regulatory developments.
  - Late or incomplete financial reporting.
  - Increased need for overdrafts or frequent requests for covenant waivers.

### The Role of a Credit Watchlist
A watchlist is an internal list of loans that are exhibiting signs of credit deterioration but are not yet formally classified as non-performing.143
**Purpose:** To identify borrowers with increased risk for more intensive monitoring and management.143
**Process:** When an analyst identifies a loan with significant early warning signs, they recommend placing it on the watchlist. This triggers more frequent reviews (e.g., monthly), closer contact with the borrower, and the development of a specific action plan to mitigate the risk and improve the credit.143

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with a case study of a company over three years. Year 1 financials are strong. Year 2 financials show a slight decline in revenue but stable margins. Year 3 financials show a continued revenue decline, a sharp drop in margins, a breach of its leverage covenant, and a footnote disclosure about the loss of its largest customer. Trainees must write a short memo identifying the early warning signs present in Year 2 and the more severe problems in Year 3, and recommend placing the loan on the credit watchlist.

### Assessment Method

Evaluation of the submitted memo. The assessment will focus on the trainee's ability to identify both subtle and obvious warning signs of credit deterioration, connect them to underlying business issues, and make a clear, actionable recommendation based on their findings.
