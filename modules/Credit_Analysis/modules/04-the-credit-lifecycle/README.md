# Module 4: The Credit Lifecycle – From Origination to Resolution

Welcome to Module 4 of the Corporate Credit Risk Analyst Foundations Training (CRAFT) program. This module walks through the entire lifecycle of a credit, from initial assessment and underwriting to ongoing monitoring and handling of problem credits. Understanding each stage is crucial for effective credit risk management.

## Key Learning Areas in This Module:

This module covers the sequential stages and key considerations throughout the life of a credit exposure:

### 1. Shared National Credit (SNC) Program Overview & Criteria (Lesson 07)
An introduction to the U.S. interagency program for reviewing and rating large syndicated credits.
*   Understanding the SNC Program: Purpose, scope ($100M+ and 3+ supervised institutions).
*   SNC Classification Criteria: Pass, Special Mention (SM), Substandard, Doubtful, Loss – and their implications.
*   Impact on Bank Portfolios: Loan loss provisions, capital adequacy, risk monitoring.

**Key Lessons & Materials:**
*   [`07-shared-national-credit-overview.md`](./07-shared-national-credit-overview.md): Core concepts and classification details.
*   [`07-snc-learning-materials.md`](./07-snc-learning-materials.md): Glossary and external resources.

### 2. Underwriting New Issuers (Lesson 08)
The comprehensive process of evaluating a new borrower and deciding whether to extend credit.
*   The Underwriting Process: From mandate/application and initial screening through due diligence, credit analysis (memo prep), committee approval, documentation, and closing/funding.
*   The Due Diligence Checklist: Financial, Business/Commercial, and Legal due diligence components.
*   The Credit Approval Process: Role of the credit committee and decision-making.

**Key Lessons & Materials:**
*   [`08-underwriting-new-issuers.md`](./08-underwriting-new-issuers.md): Detailed steps and considerations.
*   [`08-underwriting-learning-materials.md`](./08-underwriting-learning-materials.md): Glossary and due diligence checklist examples.

### 3. Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) & M&A Analysis (Lesson 09)
Analyzing credit risk in highly leveraged transactions.
*   Credit Risk in LBOs: Focus on debt service capacity with high leverage.
*   LBO Modeling from a Creditor's Perspective: Debt capacity, cash flow sweep, credit metrics, covenant compliance, sensitivity analysis.
*   M&A Credit Analysis: Strategic rationale, financing structure, synergy assessment, integration risk, pro forma financial analysis.

**Key Lessons & Materials:**
*   [`09-lbos-and-m-and-a-analysis.md`](./09-lbos-and-m-and-a-analysis.md): Analytical techniques and risk factors.
*   [`09-lbo-ma-learning-materials.md`](./09-lbo-ma-learning-materials.md): Glossary and LBO/M&A modeling resources.

### 4. Ongoing Credit Monitoring & Portfolio Review (Lesson 10)
The analyst's role after a loan is funded.
*   The Discipline of Portfolio Management: Monitoring concentration risk, continuous risk assessment, early warning systems.
*   Identifying Early Warning Signs (EWS) of Credit Deterioration: Quantitative (financial ratios, cash flow issues, covenant breaches) and Qualitative (payment habits, management changes, industry headwinds).
*   Managing the Watchlist: Triggers for watchlist inclusion, action plans, and reporting for criticized/classified assets.

**Key Lessons & Materials:**
*   [`10-ongoing-credit-monitoring.md`](./10-ongoing-credit-monitoring.md): Monitoring techniques and EWS.
*   [`10-monitoring-learning-materials.md`](./10-monitoring-learning-materials.md): Glossary and EWS checklist examples.

## Case Studies for This Module:

*   **Case Studies (`case-studies/`):**
    *   [`CS_Distressed_RetailCo_Analysis.md`](./case-studies/CS_Distressed_RetailCo_Analysis.md): Likely involves applying monitoring techniques and potentially concepts from problem loan management (a topic for future expansion in CRM_05).

## Student & Teacher Notes

**For Students:**
*   **Holistic View:** Understand that credit risk management is a continuous cycle, not a one-time event.
*   **Interconnectedness:** See how decisions made during underwriting (e.g., covenant structures) impact ongoing monitoring.
*   **Due Diligence is Key:** Recognize the critical importance of thorough due diligence before extending credit.
*   **Early Warning Signs:** Learn to be proactive in identifying potential credit problems.

**For Teachers:**
*   **Real-World Examples:** Discuss recent LBOs, M&A deals, or corporate defaults to illustrate concepts.
*   **Role-Playing:** Simulate a credit committee meeting or a due diligence call with management.
*   **Case Study Focus:** Use the Distressed RetailCo case (or develop others) to have students apply concepts from different stages of the lifecycle.
*   **SNC Discussion:** Explain the regulatory importance of the SNC program for larger bank portfolios.

## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **Expand Case Studies:** More case studies are needed, particularly:
    *   A full underwriting case for a new issuer.
    *   An LBO transaction analysis from a creditor's perspective.
    *   A scenario involving identification of EWS and placing a loan on a watchlist.
*   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   A simple checklist for due diligence items.
    *   A "what-if" tool for basic LBO leverage impact.
*   **Quizzes:** Develop quizzes for each lesson (SNC, Underwriting, LBO/M&A, Monitoring).
*   **Integration with Other Modules:** Strong links to Module 1 & 2 (Foundations, Market/Industry), Module 3 (Analyst's Craft for memo writing), Module 6 (Advanced Topics like Debt Structuring/Restructuring), and Module 14 (Legal Aspects).

## Possible Avenues for Exploration and Further Development

*   **Problem Loan Management Deep Dive:** (Currently planned for CRM_05 in `/Risk_Management/Credit_Risk/` but could be expanded within CRAFT). Detailed strategies for workouts, restructuring, bankruptcy implications.
*   **Specific Transaction Underwriting:** Guides for underwriting different types of transactions (e.g., project finance, asset-based lending).
*   **Portfolio Management Tools:** Introduction to tools or metrics used for credit portfolio monitoring beyond individual name analysis.
*   **Regulatory Capital Implications:** How different stages of the credit lifecycle (e.g., default, classification) impact regulatory capital for banks.

This module provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamic processes involved in managing credit risk from inception to potential resolution.
