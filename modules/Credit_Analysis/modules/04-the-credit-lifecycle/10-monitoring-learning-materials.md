# Learning Materials & Further Resources: Module 10 - Ongoing Credit Monitoring, Portfolio Review & Problem Loan Management

## Key Terms Glossary (Module 10)

*   **Ongoing Credit Monitoring:** The continuous process of tracking a borrower's financial performance, industry trends, covenant compliance, and other relevant factors after a loan is funded to identify any signs of deteriorating credit quality.
*   **Credit Portfolio Management (CPM):** The process of managing the risk and return characteristics of a lender's entire collection of credit assets.
*   **Concentration Risk:** The risk of loss to a lender arising from a heavy concentration of exposure to a single borrower, industry, geographic region, or type of collateral.
    *   **Single-Name Concentration:** High exposure to one borrower.
    *   **Industry Concentration:** High exposure to one economic sector.
*   **Risk Appetite Statement:** A formal document outlining the level and types of risk a financial institution is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives.
*   **Rating Migration:** The movement of borrowers' internal risk ratings up (upgrade) or down (downgrade) over time, reflecting changes in their creditworthiness.
*   **Early Warning Signs (EWS):** Quantitative or qualitative indicators that suggest a potential deterioration in a borrower's credit quality or an increased risk of default.
    *   **Quantitative EWS:** Based on financial data (e.g., declining ratios, negative cash flow, covenant breaches).
    *   **Qualitative EWS:** Based on non-financial information (e.g., management changes, industry downturns, delayed reporting).
*   **Covenant Compliance Certificate:** A formal statement provided by a borrower to its lenders, typically quarterly, certifying compliance with financial covenants and other loan terms.
*   **Waiver (Covenant Waiver):** A lender's agreement to temporarily forgive a borrower's breach of a specific loan covenant.
*   **Amendment (Loan Amendment):** A formal modification to the terms of an existing credit agreement, agreed upon by the borrower and lenders.
*   **Watchlist (Criticized and Classified Asset List):** An internal list used by lenders to designate loans that are showing signs of increased risk and require closer monitoring and management attention. Often maps to regulatory classifications (Special Mention, Substandard).
*   **Action Plan (for Watchlist Credits):** A documented strategy outlining steps to be taken by the lender and/or borrower to address issues with a deteriorating credit and mitigate risk.
*   **Forbearance Agreement:** A formal agreement where a lender agrees not to exercise its default remedies for a specified period, provided the borrower meets certain conditions or milestones. Often used for watchlist credits to give the borrower time to implement a turnaround.
*   **Problem Loan Workout (Remedial Management):** The intensive management process for loans that are in default or at high risk of default, with the primary objectives of maximizing recovery and minimizing loss for the lender.
*   **Restructuring (Debt Restructuring):** Modifying the terms of existing debt (e.g., extending maturity, reducing interest/principal, debt-for-equity swap) to help a financially distressed borrower avoid or emerge from bankruptcy. Often part of a workout.
*   **Enforcement (of Remedies):** Legal actions taken by a lender after a default to recover amounts owed, such as seizing and liquidating collateral.

## Conceptual Tools & Frameworks (Beyond this Module's Content)

*   **Portfolio Concentration Analysis Template:**
    *   Spreadsheet to track loan exposures by industry (e.g., NAICS codes), geography, single obligor, loan size, risk rating, collateral type, etc.
    *   Compare actual concentrations against internal policy limits.
*   **Risk Rating Migration Matrix Template:**
    *   A table showing how the internal risk ratings of loans in a portfolio have changed from the beginning of a period to the end (e.g., percentage of loans upgraded, downgraded, or remaining stable). Helps visualize credit quality trends.
*   **Early Warning Sign (EWS) Dashboard/Checklist:**
    *   A structured checklist of key quantitative and qualitative EWS to review periodically for each borrower.
    *   Could be developed into a dashboard with triggers/alerts if certain thresholds are breached.
*   **Watchlist Report Template:**
    *   Standardized format for reporting on watchlist credits, including:
        *   Borrower Name, Facility Details, Current Exposure, Risk Rating (current and previous).
        *   Reason for Watchlist Status, Date Added.
        *   Summary of Recent Performance & Key Issues.
        *   Action Plan (steps, responsibilities, target dates).
        *   Status of Action Plan.
        *   Updated Collateral Valuation (if applicable).
        *   Recommended Strategy & Next Steps.
*   **Basic Forbearance Agreement Term Sheet Outline:**
    *   Key points to include in a forbearance agreement: Acknowledgment of defaults, forbearance period, conditions for continued forbearance, reporting requirements, fees, reservation of rights by lender.

*(Note: Effective credit monitoring and problem loan management rely heavily on institutional policies, experienced judgment, and often negotiation skills.)*
