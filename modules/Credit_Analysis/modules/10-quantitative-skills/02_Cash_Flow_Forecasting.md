# 2.3 Cash Flow Forecasting

This sub-module focuses on the most critical element of credit analysis: forecasting a company's ability to generate cash. It emphasizes the crucial distinction between accounting profit (like EBITDA) and true, discretionary cash flow, and provides a structured approach to projecting the key drivers of cash generation.

## Learning Objectives

- Articulate the critical differences between EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, and explain why Free Cash Flow is a superior measure of debt repayment capacity.
- Construct a forecast of Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) based on projections of operating profit, taxes, and investments.
- Develop methodologies for projecting future working capital investment based on operational drivers.
- Differentiate between maintenance and growth capital expenditures (CapEx) and explain the importance of this distinction in forecasting.

## Key Concepts Outline

### EBITDA vs. True Cash Flow: A Critical Distinction
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is often used as a proxy for cash flow, but it is a flawed measure of cash-generating ability.75

**Shortcomings of EBITDA:** It is an accounting metric, not a cash flow metric. It crucially ignores two major cash uses 78:
1.  **Changes in Net Working Capital:** A growing company often consumes cash by investing in more inventory and receivables.
2.  **Capital Expenditures (CapEx):** Companies must spend cash to maintain and grow their asset base.

**Free Cash Flow (FCF):** A much more accurate measure of the cash available to service debt and provide returns to all capital providers (both debt and equity). It explicitly accounts for the cash uses that EBITDA ignores.75

### Forecasting Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)
FCFF represents the cash flow generated by a company before considering the effects of financing (i.e., before interest payments and net debt borrowings/repayments). It is the cash available to all capital providers.

**Standard Formula 79:**
`FCFF = EBIT × (1−Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Amortization − Capital Expenditures − ΔNet Working Capital`

- **EBIT × (1−Tax Rate):** Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT), the unlevered operating profit of the business.
- **+D&A:** Add back non-cash charges.
- **−CapEx:** Subtract cash spent on fixed assets.
- **−ΔNWC:** Subtract cash invested in operating assets like inventory and receivables.

### Projecting the Drivers of Cash Flow
- **Forecasting Working Capital Investment:**
  - The change in Net Working Capital (ΔNWC) is a key driver of cash flow.
  - Projections should be based on operating assumptions, not just a simple historical average.
  - Forecast individual components (AR, Inventory, AP) as a percentage of revenue or COGS, or using "days" metrics (DSO, DIH, DPO).82 For example, if revenue is projected to grow by 10%, it is logical to assume Accounts Receivable will also grow, representing a use of cash.
- **Projecting Capital Expenditures (CapEx):**
  - CapEx is a critical cash outflow needed to sustain and grow the business.
  - **Maintenance vs. Growth CapEx:** A crucial distinction for credit analysis.82
    - **Maintenance CapEx:** The amount required to sustain the company's current level of operations (e.g., replacing old machinery). This is a non-discretionary expenditure. In the long run, it often approximates depreciation expense.
    - **Growth CapEx:** Discretionary spending to expand the business (e.g., building a new factory).
  - Analysts must ensure their forecast includes sufficient maintenance CapEx to support the business's ongoing viability. Projections can be based on historical trends as a percentage of sales or management guidance.82

### Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Using the three-statement model for "StableCo" built in sub-module 2.1, trainees will add a new section to calculate and forecast Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) for the five-year projection period. They will be required to explicitly forecast maintenance CapEx (assuming it equals depreciation) and growth CapEx (based on a percentage of revenue growth). They will also project the change in Net Working Capital based on their existing balance sheet forecast.

### Assessment Method

Review of the updated Excel model. The assessment will focus on the correct calculation of the FCFF formula and the logical consistency of the underlying projections for CapEx and working capital. A short written question will ask the trainee to explain why the projected FCFF for StableCo is consistently lower than its projected EBITDA.
