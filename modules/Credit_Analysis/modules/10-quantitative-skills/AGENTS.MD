# Agent Instructions - CRAFT Module 10: Quantitative Skills

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this specific module directory.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain CRAFT program style. Content should be accessible yet cover the increasing importance of quantitative methods.
*   **Clarity:** Explain statistical and data analysis concepts clearly, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible or defining it well.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Use Markdown effectively.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure explanations of quantitative techniques and tool capabilities are accurate.
*   **File Naming:** Follow existing conventions (e.g., `19-data-analytics-quant-tools.md`).
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Link to glossaries, and relevant `Interactive_Notebooks/` or `CFA/Level_1/Quantitative_Methods/` sections.
*   **Updating Navigation:**
    *   Module navigation via `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/modules/10-quantitative-skills/index.html`. Keep its `filesInDir` and `subDirsInfo` accurate.
    *   Main CRAFT Hub also links here.
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 10 - Quantitative Skills

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`10-quantitative-skills/`) covers data analytics and quantitative tools relevant to credit risk analysis, beyond basic ratios and distinct from the AI/ML focus of Module 5.

The main guide is `README.md`. Content is detailed in `19-data-analytics-quant-tools.md` and its associated notes/materials files. Quizzes are in `quizzes/`.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** `19-data-analytics-quant-tools.md` is the primary lesson.
*   **Supporting Notes:** Includes `developer-notes.md` and `teacher-notes.md`.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Make quantitative concepts intuitive and relevant to credit analysis.
    *   Provide an awareness of tools (Excel, R, Python) without necessarily requiring deep programming knowledge from the reader in this introductory module.
    *   Emphasize the interpretation and limitations of quantitative techniques.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Explain how mean, median, standard deviation, correlation can be used to understand credit data.
*   **Probability & Regression (Conceptual):** Introduce these concepts at a high level, focusing on their application in risk rather than deep statistical theory.
*   **Data Visualization:** Stress the importance of visualizing data to identify trends and outliers.
*   **Tool Overview:** Briefly describe what Excel's advanced features, R, and Python can do for data analysis in a credit context.
*   **Practical Examples:** Use simple, relatable examples to illustrate points.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link statistical terms to `Global_Financial_Glossary.md` and local CRAFT glossary.
*   Connect to `CFA/Level_1/Quantitative_Methods/` for foundational statistical theory.
*   Link to `Interactive_Notebooks/CFA_Quant_Methods/` or other relevant notebooks that demonstrate these techniques practically.
*   If discussing alternative data, link to relevant parts of Module 5 (Future of Risk/AI) or the `/Fintech/` section.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   Interactive notebooks for statistical analysis, regression, data visualization.
*   Downloadable Excel templates for advanced functions.
*   More on alternative data sources.
*   Content on data cleaning/preparation.
