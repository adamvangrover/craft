## Conceptual Tools & Frameworks (Beyond this Module's Content)

*   **AML Program Components (The "Pillars"):**
    1.  Internal Controls (Policies, Procedures, Controls).
    2.  Designated AML Compliance Officer.
    3.  Ongoing Employee Training Program.
    4.  Independent Testing/Audit of the AML Program.
    5.  (Often added as a 5th pillar) Risk-Based Customer Due Diligence (CDD), including identifying beneficial owners.
*   **Risk-Based Approach (to AML/CDD):**
    *   The concept that institutions should allocate more resources and apply more stringent controls to customers and transactions that pose a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. This involves assessing risk factors like customer type, geography, products/services used, and transaction patterns.
*   **Credit Policy Exception Tracking & Reporting:**
    *   A system for documenting, approving (at appropriate levels), and monitoring any deviations (exceptions) from standard internal credit policy. Important for internal control and regulatory review.
*   **Compliance Training Matrix:**
    *   A schedule outlining required compliance training for different roles within the institution, including frequency and topics (AML, Fair Lending, Data Privacy, Code of Conduct, etc.).

*(Note: The regulatory environment is dynamic. Staying updated through official sources, industry publications, and internal compliance updates is crucial for all financial professionals.)*
