## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 09 - Regulatory & Ethics

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`09-regulatory-ethics/`) covers:
1.  **Regulatory Compliance in Lending:** Key U.S. banking regulations (BSA/AML, KYC, OFAC, Fair Lending, etc.) and the role of regulatory agencies.
2.  **Ethical Considerations in Credit Risk Analysis:** Adherence to professional codes, conflicts of interest, diligence, fair dealing, use of information.

The main guide is `README.md`. Content is detailed in `18-regulatory-compliance.md` and its associated notes/materials files. Quizzes are in `quizzes/`.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Content:** `18-regulatory-compliance.md` is the primary lesson file.
*   **Ethical Integration:** The `README.md` emphasizes integrating ethical considerations. Ensure this is reflected in the content or by strong links to `/Professional_Development/Ethical_Decision_Making_in_Practice.md` and CFA ethics.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Keep regulatory summaries high-level and conceptual, avoiding overly specific legal interpretations that can quickly become outdated. Focus on the *purpose* and *key requirements* of major regulations.
    *   Ethical discussions should use relatable scenarios for analysts.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **Regulatory Overviews:** For each regulation mentioned (BSA, ECOA, etc.), provide a brief explanation of its purpose and what it generally requires of financial institutions/analysts.
*   **Ethical Frameworks:** If discussing ethical decision-making, introduce simple, practical frameworks.
*   **Consequences:** Briefly outline the consequences of non-compliance (regulatory) and unethical behavior (professional).
*   **Practical Relevance:** Connect these topics to the daily responsibilities and potential dilemmas faced by credit analysts.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   Link regulatory terms (BSA, KYC, OFAC) to the local CRAFT `GLOSSARY.md` and `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Link ethical concepts to `/Professional_Development/Ethical_Decision_Making_in_Practice.md` and relevant `/CFA/` ethics sections.
*   Connect discussions of RegTech to `/Fintech/Regtech.md`.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   More explicit content on ethical frameworks within this module.
*   High-level international perspectives on regulation.
*   Interactive scenarios for ethical dilemmas or compliance checks.
