# Module 2: Understanding the Market – Capital Markets, Leveraged Loans, and Industry Analysis

Welcome to Module 2 of the Corporate Credit Risk Analyst Foundations Training (CRAFT) program. This module shifts focus from individual company financials to the broader market and industry environments in which companies operate. A thorough credit analysis requires understanding these external factors.

## Key Learning Areas in This Module:

This module covers two critical areas for contextualizing credit risk:

### 1. Capital Markets & Leveraged Loans
A corporate credit analyst operates within the capital markets. Understanding this ecosystem—its structure, participants, and products—is essential. This section covers:
*   **The Capital Ecosystem:** Primary vs. Secondary markets, Sell-side vs. Buy-side participants.
*   **The Spectrum of Debt:** Understanding the hierarchy from Senior Secured Debt (Revolvers, Term Loans) to Senior Unsecured Debt (Bonds) and Subordinated/Mezzanine Finance.
*   **Focus on the Leveraged Loan Market:** Key characteristics, syndication process, pricing (SOFR + spread, price flex), and typical uses (LBOs, M&A).
*   **Anatomy of a Credit Agreement:** Key sections (Definitions, Loan Terms, Reps & Warranties, Covenants, Events of Default).
*   **Covenants as Lender's Guardrails:** Affirmative, Negative, and Financial Covenants (Maintenance vs. Incurrence). The implications of "covenant-lite" deals.

**Key Lessons & Materials:**
*   [`03-capital-markets-and-leveraged-loans.md`](./03-capital-markets-and-leveraged-loans.md): Core concepts and explanations.
*   [`03-capital-markets-learning-materials.md`](./03-capital-markets-learning-materials.md): Glossary of key terms and links to further resources.

### 2. Industry Analysis
A company's performance is profoundly shaped by its industry. This section introduces frameworks for analyzing industry structure and competitive dynamics:
*   **Importance of Industry Context:** Why industry analysis is a prerequisite for sound credit assessment.
*   **Applying Porter's Five Forces:** A detailed look at Threat of New Entrants, Bargaining Power of Buyers, Bargaining Power of Suppliers, Threat of Substitute Products, and Rivalry Among Existing Competitors. Includes a case study application (e.g., U.S. Airline Industry).
*   **Identifying Industry-Specific Risks and Mitigants:** Cyclicality, technological disruption, regulatory risk, geopolitical factors.

**Key Lessons & Materials:**
*   [`04-industry-analysis.md`](./04-industry-analysis.md): Core concepts and explanations.
*   [`04-industry-analysis-learning-materials.md`](./04-industry-analysis-learning-materials.md): Glossary of key terms and links to further resources.

    *   [`industry-analysis-case-study-guidance.md`](./case-studies/industry-analysis-case-study-guidance.md): Guidance for the case.

## Student & Teacher Notes

**For Students:**
*   **Connect to Real Companies:** As you learn about capital markets or industry forces, think about companies you know. How do these concepts apply to them?
*   **Understand "Cov-Lite":** This is a very important practical concept in today's leveraged loan market.
*   **Porter's Five Forces is a Framework, Not a Checklist:** The value is in the *analysis* and understanding the *implications* of each force, not just listing them.
*   **Link to Module 1:** Industry context (Module 2) helps you understand the "story behind the numbers" you learned to analyze in Module 1.

**For Teachers:**
*   **Use Current Market Examples:** Discuss recent LBOs, M&A deals, or industry trends to illustrate capital market and industry analysis concepts.
*   **Debate Industry Attractiveness:** Have students apply Porter's Five Forces to different industries and debate their relative attractiveness from a creditor's perspective.
*   **Credit Agreement Review (Simplified):** If possible, show excerpts of (publicly available or anonymized) credit agreement language for key covenants.

## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **Interactive Porter's Five Forces:** Consider an interactive diagram (perhaps a Jupyter Notebook linked here or an embedded HTML/JS element in the main CRAFT hub if feasible) where users can explore each force.
*   **Leveraged Loan Market Data:** If possible to link to public sources or illustrate with sample data, showing trends in cov-lite issuance, spreads, or default rates could be impactful.
*   **Expand Case Studies:** More industry analysis case studies for diverse sectors. Case studies focusing on specific credit agreement covenant packages.
*   **Quizzes for Capital Markets/Leveraged Loans:** Currently, the quiz focuses on Industry Analysis. Add quizzes for the Capital Markets and Leveraged Loans content.

## Possible Avenues for Exploration and Further Development

*   **Deeper Dive into Specific Debt Instruments:** (e.g., High-Yield Bonds, Mezzanine structures in more detail).
*   **The Syndication Process:** More detail on bookbuilding, pricing, and allocation in loan syndications.
*   **Advanced Industry Analysis Techniques:** (e.g., Value Chain Analysis, Strategic Group Mapping).
*   **Impact of Macroeconomic Factors on Industries and Capital Markets.**
*   **Legal Aspects of Loan Documentation:** (Covered in more detail in Module 14, but could have a brief intro here).

## CRAFT Curriculum Content

This module is supplemented by the following detailed content from the CRAFT curriculum:
