## Interview Transcript

**Alex (Analyst):** Thanks for joining us. Let's start with the growth story. Revenue is up 20% year-over-year, but EBITDA margins seem to be compressing. Can you walk us through that?

**Sarah (CEO):** Absolutely. We are currently in a "land grab" phase. We've been aggressively bidding on contracts with major retailers like Nile and MegaMart. To win these, we've had to be competitive on pricing. We believe that once we have the volume, we can optimize routes and improve margins through our proprietary "ApexRoute" software.

**Mike (CFO):** To add to that, fuel costs spiked in Q2 and Q3. We have a fuel surcharge program, but there's a lag of about 30-45 days before we can pass those costs on to customers. That hit our bottom line this year.

**Alex (Analyst):** Interesting. Regarding the "ApexRoute" software – is that fully operational?

**Sarah (CEO):** It's in beta. We're rolling it out to 20% of the fleet next month. We expect it to cut fuel consumption by 10% and driver overtime by 15%.

**Alex (Analyst):** Let's talk about your customer base. It looks like your top two customers account for a significant portion of revenue.

**Mike (CFO):** Yes, Nile Corp represents about 40% of our volume, and MegaMart is another 25%. We have long-term contracts with both – 3 years with Nile, 2 years with MegaMart.

**Alex (Analyst):** Are those contracts take-or-pay? Meaning, do they guarantee a minimum volume?

**Sarah (CEO):** Not explicitly take-or-pay. But they have "primary carrier" status clauses, which means they have to offer us the loads first. Historically, they've never dipped below projected volumes.

**Alex (Analyst):** I see your Accounts Receivable days have drifted out from 35 to 45 days. Is that a collection issue?

**Mike (CFO):** It's mostly Nile. They recently changed their payment terms for all vendors to Net 60. We pushed back, but they are the 800-pound gorilla. We are managing it with our revolver.

**Alex (Analyst):** One last question on the fleet. You're asking for capex financing. Are you buying or leasing?

**Mike (CFO):** We are shifting to owning more trucks. Leases are getting expensive. We want to buy 50 new electric delivery vans.

**Sarah (CEO):** It's part of our "Green Mile" initiative. It helps us win contracts with ESG-focused clients.

## Analyst Notes & Risks (Hidden Hints)
*   **Concentration Risk:** 65% of revenue from two clients. Loss of either would be catastrophic.
*   **Margin Squeeze:** Pricing power is low. "Land grab" strategy often leads to "profitless prosperity."
*   **Working Capital:** Receivables stretching (Net 60) while they have to pay drivers weekly and fuel immediately. This creates a massive cash drag.
*   **Technology Execution:** The margin improvement relies entirely on software that is only in "beta."
*   **Contract Weakness:** "Primary carrier" is NOT a volume guarantee. If Nile's sales drop, Apex's volume drops.
