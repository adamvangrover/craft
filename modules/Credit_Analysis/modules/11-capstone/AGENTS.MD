# Agent Instructions - CRAFT Module 11: Capstone Project

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this specific module directory.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain CRAFT program style. The capstone project description should be very clear and set unambiguous expectations.
*   **Clarity and Detail:** The project requirements, deliverables, and evaluation criteria must be exceptionally clear.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Use Markdown effectively for structuring the project description and supporting notes.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure any references to concepts from previous modules are accurate.
*   **File Naming:** Follow existing conventions (e.g., `20-capstone-project.md`).
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Link to relevant CRAFT modules that provide foundational knowledge for the capstone.
*   **Updating Navigation:**
    *   Module navigation via `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/modules/11-capstone/index.html`. Keep its `filesInDir` accurate.
    *   Main CRAFT Hub also links here.
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Module 11 - Capstone Project

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/AGENTS.MD` and the root `AGENTS.MD`.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This module directory (`11-capstone/`) outlines the CRAFT program's capstone project. This project requires students to integrate and apply learning from all previous modules in a comprehensive credit analysis task.

The main guide for this module is `README.md`. The core project details are in `20-capstone-project.md`.
Supporting files include learning materials, developer notes, and teacher notes.

### 2. Hierarchy and Development Notes
*   **Core Document:** `20-capstone-project.md` is the central document defining the project.
*   **Supporting Notes:** `developer-notes.md` and `teacher-notes.md` are crucial for instructors and those maintaining/expanding the capstone.
*   **Learning Materials:** `20-capstone-learning-materials.md` should guide students to relevant resources for completing the project.
*   **No Quizzes:** This module is project-based; formal quizzes are typically not part of it.
*   **Development Focus:**
    *   Ensuring the capstone project in `20-capstone-project.md` is a realistic, challenging, yet achievable task for someone completing the CRAFT program.
    *   Making evaluation criteria clear and objective.
    *   Providing robust teacher/developer notes to support the administration of the capstone.

### 3. Specific Content Guidelines
*   **`20-capstone-project.md`:**
    *   **Clear Objectives:** What should the student demonstrate?
    *   **Detailed Case/Scenario:** Provide sufficient information for a comprehensive analysis or clear instructions on how to select a company and gather data.
    *   **Specific Deliverables:** Clearly list what needs to be submitted (e.g., Excel model, Word/PDF credit memo, presentation outline).
    *   **Evaluation Rubric:** If applicable for a formal setting, include a detailed rubric.
*   **Supporting Notes:**
    *   `teacher-notes.md`: Should offer guidance on common student challenges, areas to focus feedback on, and potential variations for the project.
    *   `developer-notes.md`: Should discuss how to update the case study, potential data sources, or ideas for alternative capstone scenarios.

### 4. Linking Strategy
*   The `20-capstone-project.md` and `20-capstone-learning-materials.md` should link extensively back to relevant lessons in Modules 01-10.
*   Link to `/Toolkits_and_Checklists/` for items like credit memo outlines or due diligence checklists that students should use.
*   Link to `/Financial_Modeling/` for best practices.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (from `README.md`)
*   Developing a library of different capstone case studies.
*   Providing anonymized examples of "good" capstone submissions.

Refer to parent `AGENTS.MD` files for broader CRAFT program and repository guidelines.
