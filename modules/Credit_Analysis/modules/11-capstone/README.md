# Module 11: Capstone Project â€“ Integrated Credit Analysis

Welcome to Module 11, the Capstone Project for the Corporate Credit Risk Analyst Foundations Training (CRAFT) program. This module is designed to be a culminating experience where you will integrate and apply the knowledge, skills, and analytical frameworks learned throughout all preceding modules.

The Capstone Project requires a comprehensive credit analysis of a given company (or a selection of companies), culminating in a written credit memorandum and potentially an outlined presentation, simulating a real-world analyst task.

**When viewing this module through the [CRAFT Program Hub](../../index.html), use the sidebar navigation to access the detailed project description, learning materials, and developer/teacher notes.**

## Key Learning Objectives & Application:

This module allows you to demonstrate mastery and integration of skills from across the CRAFT curriculum, including:

*   **Financial Statement Analysis (Module 1 & 6):** In-depth analysis of historical and projected financials, including QoE assessment.
*   **Financial Modeling (Module 1 & 2):** Construction or interpretation of a 3-statement projection model.
*   **Market & Industry Analysis (Module 2):** Assessing the company's operating environment and competitive positioning.
*   **Business Writing & Narrative (Module 3 & 7):** Crafting a clear, concise, and persuasive credit memorandum.
*   **Critical Thinking (Module 3):** Forming an independent, well-justified credit opinion.
*   **Understanding of Credit Lifecycle Components (Module 4):** Applying concepts of underwriting, risk assessment, and potentially debt structuring considerations.
*   **Awareness of Advanced Topics (Module 6, 8, 9, 10):** Incorporating relevant insights from specialized industries, legal/regulatory factors, or quantitative tools if applicable to the case.

## Core Project Components (Lesson 20):

The specifics of the Capstone Project are detailed in the main project document:

*   **[`20-capstone-project.md`](./20-capstone-project.md):** This file outlines:
    *   The project's objectives and scope.
    *   The case study information or instructions on selecting a company for analysis.
    *   Required deliverables (e.g., financial model, written credit memorandum, presentation outline).
    *   Evaluation criteria and grading rubric (if applicable in a formal training setting).
    *   Suggested timeline and milestones.

**Supporting Materials:**
*   [`20-capstone-learning-materials.md`](./20-capstone-learning-materials.md): Links to relevant CRAFT modules, external resources, or data sources useful for the capstone.
*   [`20-capstone-developer-notes.md`](./20-capstone-developer-notes.md): Notes for instructors or developers on setting up and managing the capstone project.
*   [`20-capstone-teacher-notes.md`](./20-capstone-teacher-notes.md): Guidance for instructors on evaluating submissions and providing feedback.

*(Note: This module typically does not have its own quizzes, as the project itself is the assessment.)*

## Student & Teacher Notes

**For Students (Analysts Undertaking the Capstone):**
*   **Plan Your Approach:** Break the project down into manageable tasks (e.g., data gathering, financial spreading, model building, ratio analysis, industry research, memo drafting).
*   **Refer to All Modules:** This project requires you to draw upon knowledge from the entire CRAFT program. Keep previous module materials handy.
*   **Focus on the "So What?":** Don't just present data; explain what it means for the company's creditworthiness. Your analysis and conclusions are key.
*   **Clarity and Professionalism:** Ensure your deliverables (especially the credit memo) are well-written, professionally formatted, and easy to understand.
*   **Time Management:** Allocate sufficient time for each part of the project.

**For Teachers & Trainers:**
*   **Clear Case Material:** Provide a well-defined case study or clear instructions for company selection. Ensure necessary data is available or guidance on sourcing it is given.
*   **Milestones & Feedback:** Consider setting interim milestones and providing feedback to help students stay on track.
*   **Holistic Evaluation:** Assess not just the technical components (model, ratios) but also the quality of the analysis, critical thinking, and clarity of communication in the credit memo.
*   **Simulate Credit Committee:** If feasible, have students present their findings to a mock credit committee.

## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **Case Study Variety:** Develop a library of different capstone case studies (e.g., different industries, public vs. private companies, varying levels of complexity) to allow for variety or different focus areas.
*   **Example Deliverables:** Provide anonymized examples of "good" capstone submissions (model, memo) to set expectations.
*   **Rubric Refinement:** Ensure the evaluation rubric in `20-capstone-project.md` is clear, comprehensive, and fair.
*   **Tools for Submission/Review:** In a formal training environment, consider platforms or methods for students to submit their projects and for instructors to provide feedback efficiently.

## Possible Avenues for Exploration and Further Development

*   **Group Capstone Projects:** Allowing for team-based analysis and presentation.
*   **Specialized Capstones:** Capstone projects focused on specific areas like LBO financing analysis, distressed debt analysis, or a specific industry.
*   **"Live Deal" Simulation:** (Very advanced) A capstone that simulates aspects of a live deal process with evolving information.

The Capstone Project is your opportunity to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of credit risk analysis and to produce a professional-quality work product. Good luck!
