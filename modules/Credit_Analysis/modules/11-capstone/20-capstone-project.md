# Module 20: Capstone Project - Full Credit Analysis & Presentation

## 20.1. Introduction: Synthesizing Your Skills
This Capstone Project is the culmination of the Credit Risk Analyst Foundations Training (CRAFT) program. Its purpose is to allow you to integrate and apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout all preceding modules in a comprehensive, real-world-style credit analysis.

You will take on the role of a credit analyst at a hypothetical lending institution. You will be provided with a detailed case study for a company seeking financing and will be responsible for conducting a full credit assessment, culminating in a written credit memorandum and an outline for a presentation to a credit committee.

**Project Objectives:**
*   Demonstrate proficiency in financial statement analysis and interpretation (Module 1, 12).
*   Construct and utilize a 3-statement financial model for projections and sensitivity analysis (Module 2).
*   Understand and articulate capital structure considerations (Module 3).
*   Conduct a thorough industry and competitive analysis (Module 4, 16).
*   Apply critical thinking to identify key risks, drivers, and mitigants (Module 6).
*   Understand the underwriting process and due diligence requirements (Module 8).
*   Analyze transaction-specific risks if applicable (e.g., LBO/M&A elements if embedded in case - Module 9).
*   Consider ongoing monitoring aspects and problem loan indicators (Module 10).
*   Understand relevant legal and regulatory considerations at a high level (Modules 14, 18).
*   Communicate your analysis and recommendation effectively in writing (Modules 5, 15) and prepare to do so verbally.

**This is your opportunity to showcase your comprehensive understanding and analytical capabilities.**

## 20.2. Capstone Case Study: "Innovatech Solutions Group (ISG)"

**Company Background:**
Innovatech Solutions Group (ISG) is a 10-year-old privately-held company headquartered in San Jose, California. ISG specializes in providing integrated hardware and proprietary software solutions for industrial automation and robotics, primarily serving the automotive manufacturing, logistics/warehousing, and electronics assembly sectors. They have a strong reputation for customized solutions and responsive customer support. ISG has grown steadily and is now looking to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity and invest in next-generation R&D.

**Ownership & Management:**
ISG was founded by CEO Dr. Aris Thorne (age 55, extensive robotics engineering background) and a small group of angel investors. Dr. Thorne still owns 40% of the company. Venture Capital firm "FutureGrowth Ventures" invested $20M five years ago for a 30% stake. The remaining 30% is held by other early investors and key employees. The CFO, Ms. Lena Hanson (age 45), joined 3 years ago from a publicly traded manufacturing company and has strong financial management experience. The VP of Sales, Mr. Raj Patel (age 50), has been with ISG for 7 years and has deep industry connections.

**Products & Market:**
*   **Robotic Arms & Controllers:** Customizable robotic arms for assembly, pick-and-place, and welding.
*   **Vision Systems:** AI-powered machine vision systems for quality control and guidance.
*   **"Synapse" Software Platform:** Proprietary software that integrates ISG hardware and allows for process optimization, remote monitoring, and predictive maintenance. This is a key differentiator and source of recurring service revenue.
*   **Market:** Serves large automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers, major e-commerce fulfillment centers, and electronics contract manufacturers. Customer base is somewhat concentrated, with the top 5 customers accounting for 55% of revenue. Contracts are typically 1-3 years for hardware, with ongoing software/service contracts.

**Financing Request:**
ISG is seeking a **$35 million Senior Secured Credit Facility** structured as:
1.  **$25 million Term Loan:** 5-year term, amortizing quarterly (e.g., 2.5% per quarter, with a balloon).
    *   Purpose: $15 million to build and equip a new, larger manufacturing facility. $10 million to invest in R&D for their next-gen "Synapse II" platform.
2.  **$10 million Revolving Credit Facility:** 3-year term.
    *   Purpose: Ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes.

**Management Projections - Base Case (Post-Financing & Expansion - $ thousands):**
*(Students will need to build their own detailed projections based on assumptions they derive/are given)*
*   **Year 1 (2024F):** Revenue $110,000 (driven by existing momentum, initial new capacity online late year). EBITDA $15,000. CapEx (excluding new facility build) $6,000. New facility build $10,000 (from Term Loan).
*   **Year 2 (2025F):** Revenue $135,000 (new facility fully operational). EBITDA $20,000. CapEx $7,000.
*   **Year 3 (2026F):** Revenue $155,000. EBITDA $25,000. CapEx $7,500.
*   *Key Assumption for Students:* Develop detailed assumptions for margins, working capital, D&A, taxes, and interest on new debt to build out the model. Assume new Term Loan is drawn fully at start of 2024F. Revolver undrawn initially.

**Industry & Market Notes:**
*   Industrial automation/robotics market is growing robustly (e.g., 10-15% CAGR) due to trends like re-shoring, labor shortages, and demand for efficiency/quality.
*   Highly competitive with large global players (e.g., ABB, Fanuc, Kuka) and smaller niche specialists.
*   Technological innovation is rapid; R&D is critical.
*   Supply chain for components (semiconductors, specialized materials) can be volatile.
*   Long sales cycles for large hardware installations. Software/service contracts provide more stable recurring revenue.

## 20.3. Project Deliverables

## 20.5. Student Notes & Reflections

As you embark on this Capstone Project:

1.  **Planning Your Approach:**
    *   How will you break down this large project into manageable tasks? What is your timeline?
    *   Which modules from the course do you anticipate revisiting most frequently as you work on this project?

2.  **Financial Modeling Challenges:**
    *   What do you foresee as the most challenging aspects of building the 3-statement model for ISG based on the information provided? (e.g., deriving assumptions, balancing the model, building schedules).
    *   What key assumptions will you need to make for the "Synapse II" R&D investment and the new facility? How will you reflect these in the model?

3.  **Risk Identification & Mitigation:**
    *   Beyond the obvious (e.g., customer concentration), what are some more nuanced risks you might consider for ISG?
    *   When thinking about mitigants, how will you balance structural protections (covenants, security) with reliance on management action or company strengths?

4.  **Crafting the Narrative:**
    *   What is the central "story" or credit thesis you want to convey about ISG and this financing request?
    *   How will you ensure your Executive Summary is compelling and effectively summarizes your detailed analysis for a busy credit committee?

5.  **Presentation Strategy:**
    *   If you were actually presenting this to a credit committee, what would be the 2-3 most important points you would want them to take away? How would you emphasize these in your presentation outline?

**Project Journal (Optional but Recommended):**
*   Keep brief notes as you progress:
    *   Key decisions made (and why).
    *   Challenges encountered and how you overcame them.
    *   Key insights gained.
    *   Questions you had that you needed to research or think through.
*   This can be helpful for self-reflection and also if you need to discuss your project approach.

**This Capstone is designed to simulate a real-world analytical assignment. Embrace the complexity, apply your skills diligently, and focus on producing a high-quality, well-reasoned output.**
