# 02: Key Market Products for Credit Analysts

This document provides a brief overview of major financial products that credit analysts frequently encounter. Understanding their basic features, typical investors, and relevance to credit is crucial.

## 1. Corporate Bonds

*   **Definition:** Debt securities issued by corporations to raise capital. Bondholders are creditors to the company.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Face Value (Par Value):** Principal amount repaid at maturity.
    *   **Coupon Rate:** Stated interest rate paid to bondholders (can be fixed or floating).
    *   **Maturity Date:** Date when the principal is repaid.
    *   **Indenture:** Legal contract specifying terms, covenants, and rights.
*   **Types from a Credit Perspective:**
    *   **Investment Grade (IG) Bonds:** Rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher. Considered lower risk of default.
        *   *Typical Investors:* Insurance companies, pension funds, bond mutual funds, foreign central banks.
        *   *Credit Relevance:* Focus on stable cash flows, strong balance sheets, consistent profitability. Lower yields.
    *   **High Yield (HY) Bonds (Junk Bonds):** Rated BB+/Ba1 or lower. Higher risk of default, compensated by higher yields.
        *   *Typical Investors:* Specialized HY mutual funds, hedge funds, CLOs, distressed debt funds.
        *   *Credit Relevance:* Focus on cash flow generation, asset coverage, covenant protections, potential for turnaround or restructuring. More equity-like characteristics in terms of risk and volatility.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Secured Bonds:** Backed by specific collateral (e.g., property, equipment). Lower LGD.
    *   **Unsecured Bonds (Debentures):** Backed only by the general creditworthiness of the issuer. Higher LGD.
*   **Seniority:** Rank in the capital structure for claims on assets/cash flow in case of bankruptcy (e.g., senior secured, senior unsecured, subordinated).

## 2. Leveraged Loans

*   **Definition:** Loans extended to companies that are already highly levered (i.e., have significant debt) or have speculative-grade credit ratings.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Typically **senior secured** in the capital structure, often secured by a first lien on the borrower's assets.
    *   Interest rates are usually **floating**, based on a benchmark rate (e.g., SOFR, Term SOFR) plus a credit spread.
    *   Often have **covenants** (though "covenant-lite" deals with fewer maintenance covenants have become common).
    *   Can be **amortizing** (principal paid down over time) or have **bullet maturities** (principal paid at maturity).
*   **Types:**
    *   **Revolving Credit Facility (RCF or Revolver):** Acts like a corporate credit card. Allows borrowers to draw down, repay, and re-draw funds up to a specified limit. Used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Often has the most stringent covenants.
    *   **Term Loan A (TLA):** Typically amortizing (e.g., 5-7 year maturity), often held by commercial banks. More conservative terms.
    *   **Term Loan B (TLB), C (TLC), etc.:** Longer maturities (e.g., 6-8 years), often with minimal or no amortization (bullet or near-bullet). Primarily syndicated to institutional investors like CLOs, hedge funds, and loan mutual funds. Usually higher priced than TLAs.
*   **Syndication:** Large leveraged loans are typically originated by a lead investment bank (or group of banks) and then sold (syndicated) to a broader group of lenders/investors.
*   **Credit Relevance:** Focus on cash flow to service floating rate debt, collateral value, covenant compliance (if applicable), and recovery prospects given senior secured status. Highly sensitive to economic cycles and interest rate changes.

## 3. Equities

*   **Definition:** Represent ownership interest in a company.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Common Stock (Common Equity):** Represents residual claim on assets and earnings after debtholders and preferred stockholders. Holders have voting rights.
    *   **Preferred Stock:** A hybrid security with characteristics of both debt (fixed dividend payments, priority over common stock in dividends and liquidation) and equity (no maturity date, dividends not tax-deductible for issuer). Dividends can be cumulative or non-cumulative.
*   **Credit Relevance:**
    *   **Equity Cushion:** The amount of common equity in a company's capital structure provides a buffer to absorb losses before debtholders are impacted. A larger equity cushion is generally positive for credit quality.
    *   **Market Capitalization / Enterprise Value:** Used in leverage ratios (e.g., Debt/Enterprise Value) and can indicate market perception of the company's value and growth prospects.
    *   **Access to Capital:** A publicly traded company with a healthy stock price generally has better access to equity capital markets, which can be a source of funds to repay debt or strengthen the balance sheet.
    *   **Dividends and Share Repurchases:** These payments to equity holders reduce cash available for debt service and can be restricted by covenants if credit quality deteriorates.

## 4. Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

*   **Definition:** A financial derivative that allows an investor to "buy" protection against the default of a specific bond or loan (the "reference entity").
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   **Protection Buyer:** Pays a periodic fee (the CDS spread, quoted in basis points per annum of the notional amount) to the protection seller.
    *   **Protection Seller:** Receives the spread and agrees to compensate the buyer if a predefined "credit event" (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to pay, restructuring) occurs for the reference entity. Compensation can be physical settlement (buyer delivers defaulted bond to seller for par) or cash settlement.
*   **Credit Relevance:**
    *   **Hedging Credit Risk:** Lenders/bondholders can buy CDS protection to hedge their exposure to a specific credit.
    *   **Speculating on Credit Quality:** Investors can buy CDS if they expect credit quality to deteriorate (spreads to widen) or sell CDS (short protection) if they expect credit quality to improve or remain stable.
    *   **Market Indicator:** CDS spreads are often viewed as a market-implied measure of default probability for a reference entity. Changes in CDS spreads can signal changes in perceived credit risk.
    *   **Basis:** The difference between a bond's cash market credit spread and its CDS spread can indicate relative value or technical market factors.

## 5. Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)

*   **Definition:** A type of structured finance security that pools together a portfolio of underlying assets (typically leveraged loans, but sometimes bonds) and issues different tranches (slices) of debt and equity with varying risk/return profiles.
*   **Structure:**
    *   A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) buys a portfolio of loans.
    *   The SPV finances these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt (e.g., AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB - rated by rating agencies) and an equity tranche.
    *   Cash flows from the underlying loan portfolio (interest and principal payments) are paid out to the CLO tranche holders in order of seniority (waterfall structure). AAA tranches get paid first, equity last.
*   **Credit Relevance:**
    *   **Major Buyers of Leveraged Loans:** CLOs are significant investors in the leveraged loan market. Their demand influences pricing and availability of capital for leveraged borrowers.
    *   **Risk Transformation:** CLOs transform the risk of a diversified pool of loans into different risk profiles suitable for different types_of investors.
    *   **Systemic Risk (Historically):** While different from CDOs of the financial crisis era (which often held subprime mortgages), understanding CLO structures and their performance is important for overall market stability.
    *   **Credit Analysis of CLO Tranches:** Involves analyzing the credit quality of the underlying loan collateral pool, the CLO's structural protections (e.g., overcollateralization, interest coverage tests), and the manager's skill.

Understanding these products is the first step for an analyst to effectively assess their risks, understand their trading behavior, and how they fit into a company's capital structure or an investment portfolio.
