# Project Finance: A Comprehensive Guide

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Project Finance (PF) is distinct from Corporate Finance. In PF, creditors rely primarily on the cash flow generated by a specific project for repayment, rather than the general creditworthiness of the sponsors. For an analyst, this means the analysis shifts from "Company Analysis" to "Asset Analysis" and "Contract Analysis".

## 1. Introduction to Project Finance

Project Finance is the financing of long-term infrastructure, industrial projects, and public services using a non-recourse or limited-recourse financial structure. The debt and equity used to finance the project are paid back from the cash flow generated by the project.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV):** The project is housed in a separate legal entity.
*   **Non-Recourse Debt:** Lenders have no claim on the sponsors' assets beyond the project itself (or very limited recourse).
*   **Off-Balance Sheet:** For sponsors, the debt often does not appear on their balance sheet.
*   **High Leverage:** Projects can often support higher debt loads (60-80%) due to predictable cash flows.
*   **Long Tenor:** Debt maturities often match the long life of the asset (15-20 years).

## 2. Key Parties

*   **Sponsors:** The equity investors who initiate the project.
*   **Lenders:** Banks or bondholders providing debt.
*   **Off-taker:** The party purchasing the project's output (e.g., a utility buying power). Critical for revenue stability.
*   **EPC Contractor:** Engineering, Procurement, and Construction contractor responsible for building the project.
*   **O&M Operator:** Operations and Maintenance provider.

## 3. Risk Allocation

The essence of Project Finance is allocating risk to the party best able to manage it.

| Risk Category | Key Risks | Typical Mitigant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Construction** | Delays, Cost Overruns, Tech Failure | Fixed-Price EPC Contract, Liquidated Damages |
| **Operational** | Equipment Breakdown, OpEx Increase | O&M Contract, Reserve Accounts |
| **Market/Revenue** | Price Volatility, Demand Risk | Long-term Offtake Agreement (PPA) |
| **Supply** | Fuel Availability, Price Spikes | Long-term Supply Agreement |
| **Political** | Expropriation, Change in Law | Political Risk Insurance, Gov't Guarantees |

> **Pro Tip:** In Project Finance, "Cash is King". The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is the single most important metric. Unlike corporate finance where you might look at Debt/EBITDA, in PF you are modeling the precise quarterly cash flows available to pay debt service.
