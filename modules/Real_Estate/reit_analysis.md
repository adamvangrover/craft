# REIT Analysis: Deep Dive into Valuation

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> REITs offer liquidity to an illiquid asset class. However, they trade like stocks. The analyst must determine if the REIT is trading at a premium or discount to the private market value of its properties (NAV). A persistent discount makes the REIT a takeover target.

## 1. Calculating Net Asset Value (NAV)

The NAV model is the "Gold Standard" for REIT valuation.

**Step 1: Determine Gross Asset Value**
*   **Stabilized Properties:** Capitalize TTM NOI using market Cap Rates (by geography/asset type).
*   **Properties Under Development:** Value at book cost or expected completed value discounted back.
*   **Land Bank:** Value at market price per acre/sqft.
*   **JV Interests:** Value the pro-rata share.

**Step 2: Add Other Assets**
*   Cash & Equivalents.
*   Accounts Receivable.
*   Prepaid Expenses.

**Step 3: Subtract Liabilities**
*   Total Debt (mark-to-market if fixed rates are significantly different from spot).
*   Other Liabilities (Payables).
*   Preferred Stock.

**Step 4: Divide by Share Count**
*   Use fully diluted share count (including OP Units).

**Result:** NAV Per Share.
*   **Price < NAV:** Stock is cheap (Discount). Potential opportunity.
*   **Price > NAV:** Stock is expensive (Premium). Market expects value creation from management.

## 2. Same-Store NOI Growth (SSNOI)

A critical organic growth metric. It measures the growth in NOI for properties owned for the full current and prior periods (excluding acquisitions/disposals).
*   **Drivers:** Rent bumps, occupancy gains, operating efficiency.
*   **Significance:** High SSNOI growth justifies a premium valuation (lower Implied Cap Rate).

## 3. Leverage Metrics in REITs

*   **Net Debt / EBITDA:** Standard leverage metric. REITs typically run 5.0x - 7.0x (higher than corporates due to stable cash flows).
*   **Debt / Gross Assets:** LTV-like metric. Typically 30-50%.
*   **Interest Coverage:** EBITDA / Interest Expense. Should be > 3.0x.

## 4. Lease Terms & Expirations (WALT)

**Weighted Average Lease Term (WALT)**
*   Short WALT (e.g., Hotels, Apartments): Good in inflation (reset rents quickly), bad in recession.
*   Long WALT (e.g., Office, Net Lease): Stable cash flow (bond-like), but interest rate sensitive.

> **Pro Tip:** Watch out for "Straight-Line Rent" adjustments in GAAP NOI. Use "Cash NOI" for valuation to strip out non-cash rent smoothing effects.
