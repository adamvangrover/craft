# Real Estate Financial Analysis

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Real Estate analysis combines "Bond-like" characteristics (contractual leases) with "Equity-like" upside (property appreciation, operating improvements). The analysis focuses heavily on the stability of Net Operating Income (NOI) and the appropriate Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate).

## 1. Fundamentals of Real Estate

Real estate can be categorized by asset class, each with unique drivers:
*   **Office:** Tied to employment growth. Long-term leases but high CapEx (Tenant Improvements).
*   **Retail:** Tied to consumer spending. Risks include e-commerce and tenant health.
*   **Multifamily (Apartments):** Tied to demographics and household formation. Short-term leases (1 year), adjusting quickly to inflation.
*   **Industrial:** Tied to logistics and trade. Strong growth recently due to e-commerce.
*   **Hospitality (Hotels):** Tied to travel/tourism. Daily leases (room rates), highly volatile.

## 2. Key Metrics

### Net Operating Income (NOI)
The core measure of property profitability.
$$ \text{NOI} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Operating Expenses} $$
*   *Revenue:* Rent, Parking, Service Charges.
*   *OpEx:* Taxes, Insurance, Maintenance, Utilities, Management Fees.
*   *Note:* NOI excludes Interest, Taxes (Income), Depreciation, and Amortization.

### Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)
The yield of the property.
$$ \text{Cap Rate} = \frac{\text{NOI}}{\text{Property Value}} $$
*   Used for valuation: $\text{Value} = \text{NOI} / \text{Cap Rate}$
*   A lower Cap Rate implies higher value and lower perceived risk.

### Funds From Operations (FFO)
The standard metric for REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
$$ \text{FFO} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation} - \text{Gains from Sales of Assets} $$
*   Since real estate tends to appreciate, accounting depreciation distorts Net Income. FFO adds it back.

### Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)
A proxy for free cash flow.
$$ \text{AFFO} = \text{FFO} - \text{Recurring Capital Expenditures (Maintenance)} $$

## 3. Valuation Methods

1.  **Direct Capitalization:** Value = Stabilized NOI / Market Cap Rate. Best for stable properties.
2.  **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):** Project cash flows over a holding period (e.g., 10 years) and a terminal sale value. Best for properties with changing cash flows (lease-up phase).
3.  **Net Asset Value (NAV):** For REITs. The market value of all underlying assets minus debt. Compare REIT share price to NAV per share (Trading at Premium vs. Discount).

> **Pro Tip:** In commercial real estate, the "Credit Tenant" matters. A building leased to Google (AAA) is worth more (lower Cap Rate) than the same building leased to a startup, even if the rent is the same today.
