                <p>While both "Pharma" and "Biotech" companies develop drugs, their methods, products, and risk profiles can be distinct. Historically, Pharma focused on small molecule, chemically-synthesized drugs, while Biotech focused on large molecule, biologic drugs derived from living organisms. Today, the lines have blurred as Big Pharma has acquired biotech platforms, but the core differences remain relevant for analysis.</p>

                    <div class="primer-section-content">
                        <h4>Big Pharma: The Patent Cliff</h4>
                        <p>The biggest risk for a large, established pharmaceutical company is the <span class="key-term">"patent cliff."</span> Their blockbuster drugs are protected by patents for a limited time. When a patent expires, cheap generic versions flood the market, and sales of the branded drug can fall by over 90% within a year. Therefore, the company is in a constant race to innovate and launch new drugs (or acquire biotechs) to replace the revenue from those falling off the cliff.</p>
                        <p>Credit analysis of Big Pharma focuses on the strength and diversity of the R&D pipeline to ensure it can withstand these patent cliffs and generate future growth.</p>

                        <h4>Biotechnology: Binary Risk</h4>
                        <p>A small, clinical-stage biotech company faces a more immediate, existential risk often called <span class="key-term">"binary risk."</span> The company's entire value may be tied to the success or failure of a single drug in a pivotal clinical trial.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Positive Result:</strong> The company's value can multiply overnight. It may get acquired by Big Pharma or become a commercial entity itself.</li>
                            <li><strong>Negative Result:</strong> The company's value can go to zero. It may run out of cash and be forced to shut down.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Credit analysis of a clinical-stage biotech is extremely speculative and focuses on the probability of clinical success (based on early data) and the company's <span class="key-term">cash runway</span> to complete its trials.</p>

                        <h4>Manufacturing Complexity & Generic vs. Biosimilar Competition</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Small Molecules (Pharma):</strong> A standardized, chemical synthesis process. Relatively easy and cheap to replicate. This allows for direct <span class="key-term">generic</span> competition, which is chemically identical and interchangeable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Large Molecules (Biotech):</strong> A complex, sensitive process involving living cell cultures. It is much harder and more expensive to create a "copy." This leads to the concept of <span class="key-term">"biosimilars"</span> rather than generics. Biosimilars are similar but not identical copies, and they often face a slower and less severe erosion of sales compared to generics. This provides a longer and more durable revenue tail for successful biologic drugs even after patent expiry.</li>
