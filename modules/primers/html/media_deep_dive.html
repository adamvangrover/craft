                <p>The "Streaming Wars" refers to the period of intense competition between major media and tech companies to dominate the direct-to-consumer video streaming market. This battle has fundamentally reshaped the industry's economics, forcing massive investment in content and technology, and destroying billions in shareholder value in the process.</p>

                    <div class="primer-section-content">
                        <h4>Phase 1: The Land Grab (2017-2021)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Acquire subscribers at any cost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Launch new services (Disney+, HBO Max, Peacock) with massive marketing budgets and deep libraries of content. Spend billions on splashy original series and movies to make headlines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Key Metric:</strong> Subscriber growth. Wall Street rewarded companies that posted the highest net subscriber additions, ignoring profitability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> Enormous cash burn. Companies like Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery sacrificed billions in high-margin licensing revenue (by pulling content from rivals like Netflix) and incurred massive operating losses in their DTC segments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Phase 2: The Reckoning & Pivot to Profitability (2022-Present)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Achieve profitability and sustainable free cash flow.</li>
                            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Price Increases:</strong> Sharp and frequent price hikes across most major services.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Advertising Tiers:</strong> Launching cheaper, ad-supported plans to boost Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and attract price-sensitive consumers.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Content Rationalization:</strong> Pulling back on the "content for content's sake" model. Focusing on quality over quantity, removing underperforming shows to cut costs, and even re-licensing content to rivals to generate revenue.</li>
                                    <li><strong>The "New Bundle":</strong> Partnerships and bundles to reduce churn (e.g., Verizon offering a discounted Netflix/Max bundle).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Key Metrics:</strong> ARPU, churn, operating margin, and free cash flow.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Phase 3: The Endgame & Consolidation (Future)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Survival and long-term market position.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The market is unlikely to support the current number of major streaming services. This will likely lead to further M&A and consolidation as weaker players are acquired, forced to merge, or become pure content arms that license to larger platforms.</li>
                        </ul>
