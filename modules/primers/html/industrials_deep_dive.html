                <p>Within the broader Industrials sector, Capital Goods and Transportation companies are both cyclical, but their business models and key drivers are different. Capital Goods are tied to business investment cycles (capex), while Transportation is tied to the real-time flow of goods and people across the economy.</p>

                        <h4>Capital Goods: Long, Drawn-Out Cycles</h4>
                        <p>Capital goods companies are typically <span class="key-term">"late-cycle."</span> Demand for their products only picks up well into an economic expansion, when businesses are confident enough to make large, long-term investments. The flip side is that their large <span class="key-term">backlogs</span> provide a significant cushion during a downturn. Even as new orders slow, the company can continue to work through its existing backlog, providing revenue visibility for several quarters or even years.</p>
                        <p>A key credit positive is a large, stable, and high-margin <span class="key-term">aftermarket</span> business. Even when companies aren't buying new machines, they still need to buy spare parts and service their existing fleet, providing a defensive stream of cash flow that supports credit quality through the cycle.</p>

                        <h4>Transportation: Short, Sharp Cycles</h4>
                        <p>Transportation companies are <span class="key-term">"early-cycle."</span> Demand for their services moves in lockstep with the broader economy. Freight volumes can fall quickly at the start of a recession and rebound just as quickly at the first sign of recovery. This provides very little forward revenue visibility outside of long-term contracts.</p>
                        <p>Credit analysis focuses heavily on operational efficiency (e.g., the <span class="key-term">Operating Ratio</span> for railroads) and the ability to manage volatile fuel costs and high fixed labor expenses through the cycle. Companies with flexible cost structures are better positioned to weather downturns.</p>
