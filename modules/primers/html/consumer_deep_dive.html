Their performance through an economic cycle is fundamentally different, which has major implications for revenue visibility, cash flow stability, and appropriate leverage levels.</p>

                    <div class="primer-section-content">
                        <h4>Consumer Staples</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Margin Squeeze:</strong> The biggest risk is input cost inflation. If a company cannot pass on rising commodity and freight costs to consumers through price increases, its gross margins will shrink. This is the primary driver of earnings volatility for staples companies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Private Label Threat:</strong> During recessions, consumers may "trade down" from national brands (e.g., Heinz Ketchup) to cheaper store brands (e.g., Walmart's Great Value ketchup), eroding market share.</li>
                            <li><strong>Portfolio Stagnation:</strong> Long-term shifts in consumer preferences (e.g., away from processed foods toward healthier options) can cause secular decline if a company fails to innovate or acquire new brands to adapt its portfolio.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Consumer Discretionary</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Recession Risk:</strong> The primary risk is an economic downturn leading to a collapse in demand as consumers cut back on non-essential spending.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inventory Risk:</strong> If demand is overestimated, companies can be stuck with excess inventory that must be sold at a deep discount, crushing profitability. This is especially acute in the fashion industry where trends change quickly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brand Relevance:</strong> A discretionary brand must remain "cool" and relevant to consumers. A loss of brand image can lead to a rapid and sometimes irreversible decline in sales.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </details>

                    <div class="primer-section-content">
                        <h4>Credit Analyst View</h4>
                        <p>From a credit perspective, Consumer Staples companies are generally considered <span class="key-term">lower risk</span> than Discretionary companies. The predictability of their cash flows makes them more reliable borrowers. When analyzing a Staples company, the focus is on its ability to manage costs and defend its market share through brand investment. For a Discretionary company, the focus is on its balance sheet strength (low leverage) and liquidity, which determine its ability to survive a recession.</p>
                        <h4>Equity Investor View</h4>
                        <p>Equity investors see Staples as <span class="key-term">"defensive"</span> stocks that should provide stability to a portfolio during a downturn. Discretionary stocks are seen as <span class="key-term">"cyclical"</span> plays that can provide high returns during an economic expansion but also carry higher risk and potential for greater losses.</p>
