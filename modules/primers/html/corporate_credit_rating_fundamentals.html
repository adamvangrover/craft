                        <p>While the core principles are similar, S&P and Moody's have distinct published methodologies for various industries and for corporate <span class="key-term">ratings</span> in general.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>S&P's Corporate Methodology Framework:</strong> Often starts with an assessment of the Business <span class="key-term">Risk</span> Profile and Financial <span class="key-term">Risk</span> Profile, which are scored (e.g., Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Fair, Weak, Vulnerable). These scores are then combined in a matrix to arrive at an "anchor" <span class="key-term">rating</span>. This anchor can then be adjusted by various modifiers (e.g., <span class="key-term">diversification</span>, <span class="key-term">capital</span> structure, <span class="key-term">liquidity</span>, financial policy, management and governance) to arrive at the final issuer credit <span class="key-term">rating</span>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Moody's Corporate Methodology Framework:</strong> Also emphasizes the interplay between business fundamentals and financial strength. Moody's often uses a scorecard approach within its industry-specific methodologies, assigning scores or weights to various factors and sub-factors. Key analytical themes include:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Scale</li>
                                    <li>Business Profile (often encompassing industry dynamics, competitive position)</li>
                                    <li>Profitability and <span class="key-term">Leverage</span></li>
                                    <li>Financial Policy</li>
                                    <li>Other factors (e.g., structural considerations, sovereign linkages).</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It's crucial for analysts to consult the specific, up-to-date methodologies published by the <span class="key-term">rating</span> agencies for the relevant industry and for general corporate criteria.

                        <p>Industry characteristics are a cornerstone of credit analysis. A company's credit profile cannot be assessed in a vacuum. Different industries have:</p>
