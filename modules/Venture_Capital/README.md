# Venture Capital: Financing Innovation

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Venture Capital (VC) is high-risk, high-reward finance for startups with unproven models. Unlike traditional credit analysis, VC relies less on historical financials (often non-existent) and more on "Power Law" mechanics, market size (TAM), and deal structure protection.

## 1. The VC Model

*   **Equity Financing:** Startups rarely have cash flow for debt. Capital is provided in exchange for Preferred Equity.
*   **Power Law:** In a VC fund, 1-2 companies ("Home Runs") return the entire fund. The rest may fail or return capital.
*   **Staged Financing:** Capital is released in rounds (Seed, Series A, B, C) as milestones are met, reducing risk over time.

## 2. Valuation in VC

Valuation is often an art, not a science (no DCF).

*   **Pre-Money Valuation:** Value of the company before the new cash comes in.
*   **Post-Money Valuation:** Pre-Money + Investment Amount.
*   **Dilution:** The reduction in % ownership for existing shareholders when new shares are issued.

## 3. Key Metrics for Startups

*   **Burn Rate:** Monthly cash consumption.
*   **Runway:** Cash Balance / Burn Rate (Months until cash out).
*   **CAC:** Customer Acquisition Cost.
*   **LTV:** Lifetime Value of a customer.
*   **LTV/CAC:** Should be > 3x for sustainable growth.
*   **Churn:** % of customers lost per period.

## 4. Venture Debt

A niche form of credit provided to VC-backed startups.
*   **Security:** Senior secured lien on IP and assets.
*   **Repayment:** Often interest-only periods followed by amortization.
*   **Underwriting:** Lenders bet on the *investors* (VCs) continuing to support the company, not just current cash flow.
*   **Warrants:** Lenders receive equity warrants to boost returns (Upside).

> **Pro Tip:** In VC, "Down Rounds" (raising at a lower valuation than the previous round) can trigger severe anti-dilution provisions, crushing common shareholders (founders/employees).
