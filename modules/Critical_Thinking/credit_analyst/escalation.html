            <h2>When and How to Escalate a Credit Issue</h2>
            <p>Escalation is the process of raising a credit issue to a higher level of management. It's an important part of credit risk management, as it ensures that potential problems are addressed in a timely and effective manner.</p>
            <h3>When to Escalate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When you identify a material risk:</strong> If you identify a risk that could have a significant impact on the borrower's ability to repay the loan, you should escalate it immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>When you're not getting the information you need:</strong> If the borrower is not providing you with the information you need to assess their financial health, you should escalate the issue.</li>
                <li><strong>When you're not comfortable with the situation:</strong> If you have a gut feeling that something is wrong, it's always better to err on the side of caution and escalate the issue.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Escalate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be prepared:</strong> Before you escalate the issue, make sure you have all the facts. Be prepared to explain the situation clearly and concisely.</li>
                <li><strong>Be professional:</strong> Even if you're frustrated, always be professional. Don't let your emotions get the best of you.</li>
                <li><strong>Be persistent:</strong> Don't give up. If you don't get a satisfactory response, keep escalating the issue until you do.</li>
            </ul>
