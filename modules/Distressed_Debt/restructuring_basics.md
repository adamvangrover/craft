# Restructuring Mechanics & Strategies

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Successful restructuring requires mastering the "Game Theory" of creditor classes. Each class (Secured, Unsecured, Equity) acts in its own self-interest. Understanding who has leverage \u2013 and who loses it \u2013 is key to predicting the outcome.

## 1. The Bankruptcy Waterfall

The priority of claims in liquidation (Chapter 7) or reorganization (Chapter 11) is typically:

1.  **Super-Priority Claims:** DIP Financing.
2.  **Administrative Expenses:** Lawyers, bankers, court fees (running the bankruptcy).
3.  **Priority Claims:** Specific taxes, some employee wages.
4.  **Secured Claims:** Debt backed by specific collateral (up to the value of that collateral).
5.  **Unsecured Claims:** Bonds, trade payables, deficiency claims (if collateral < debt).
6.  **Subordinated Claims:** Junior debt.
7.  **Equity Interests:** Preferred and Common stock (usually wiped out).

## 2. The Fulcrum Security

Identifying the Fulcrum Security is critical.

*   **Scenario:**
    *   Senior Debt: $100M
    *   Junior Debt: $50M
    *   Enterprise Value: $120M
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Senior Debt is fully covered ($100M).
    *   Remaining Value: $20M.
    *   Junior Debt Claim: $50M.
    *   **Result:** Junior Debt is the Fulcrum. They are "in the money" but impaired. They will likely receive the Equity of the new company (worth $20M) in exchange for their $50M debt claim. Old Equity gets zero.

## 3. Strategies

### "Loan-to-Own"
An investor buys the Fulcrum Security (e.g., Junior Debt) at a discount, aiming to convert it into controlling equity in the reorganized company. If the company is fundamentally sound but over-levered, this is a path to acquiring a business at a low multiple.

### "Credit Bidding"
Secured creditors have the right to "credit bid" the face value of their debt at an auction of the assets. This effectively sets a floor price and often allows them to acquire the assets if no higher cash bid emerges.

### Pre-Packaged Bankruptcy ("Pre-Pack")
The debtor negotiates a plan with key creditors *before* filing. They enter Chapter 11 with a deal in hand, speeding up the process (e.g., 30-60 days) and minimizing business disruption.

## 4. Key Legal Battles

*   **Valuation Fights:** Senior lenders argue for a *lower* valuation (to wipe out juniors and take 100% equity). Junior lenders argue for a *higher* valuation (to prove they are "in the money" and deserve a recovery).
*   **Equitable Subordination:** If a creditor acted in bad faith, the court can subordinate their claim.
*   **Substantive Consolidation:** Treating multiple legal entities as one pool of assets/liabilities (dangerous for creditors of a "good" subsidiary).

> **Pro Tip:** Watch out for "Up-Tiering" or "Priming" transactions (like the J.Crew or Serta Simmons cases) where a group of lenders amends documents to strip collateral from non-participating lenders.
