# Distressed Debt: Investing in Stressed & Distressed Assets

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Distressed debt investing seeks high returns by buying the debt of companies in or near bankruptcy. The thesis is often that the market has overreacted, pricing the debt below its true recovery value, or that the creditor can influence a restructuring to own the equity of the reorganized company ("Loan-to-Own").

## 1. Defining "Distressed"

Distressed debt typically trades at a significant discount to par (e.g., < 70 cents on the dollar) and has a high yield (e.g., > 10% spread over treasuries).

*   **Stressed:** Company is facing operational headwinds, liquidity is tight, but default is not imminent.
*   **Distressed:** Default is probable or has occurred. Capital structure is unsustainable.

## 2. The Restructuring Spectrum

When a company cannot meet its obligations, it must restructure.

### Out-of-Court Restructuring
*   **Voluntary Exchange:** Bondholders agree to swap existing debt for new debt with longer maturities or lower face value (Distressed Debt Exchange - DDE).
*   **Pros:** Cheaper, faster, preserves privacy.
*   **Cons:** Hard to get 100% participation (holdout problem).

### In-Court Restructuring (Chapter 11 Bankruptcy)
*   **Process:** Company files for protection, management stays in place ("Debtor-in-Possession").
*   **Automatic Stay:** Freezes all creditor actions (lawsuits, foreclosure).
*   **Plan of Reorganization:** Debtor proposes a plan to resize the balance sheet.
*   **Cramdown:** Court can force a plan on dissenting creditor classes if it is "fair and equitable".

## 3. Valuation in Distress

Valuation is the battleground of restructuring.
*   **Enterprise Value (EV) determines Recovery:** If EV > Senior Debt, Senior gets 100%. If EV < Senior Debt, Senior takes a haircut, and Juniors get zero.
*   **The Fulcrum Security:** The class of debt where the value "breaks". The Fulcrum Security typically converts to equity and controls the reorganized company.

## 4. Key Concepts

*   **Blocking Position:** Holding enough debt (usually 1/3 or 1/2 of a class) to block a plan of reorganization, giving you leverage to negotiate a better deal.
*   **DIP Financing:** "Debtor-in-Possession" financing. New money lent to a bankrupt company to keep it running. It gets "Super-Priority" status (paid before almost everyone else).
*   **Voidable Preferences:** Payments made to certain creditors shortly before filing that can be clawed back.

> **Pro Tip:** Read the "Intercreditor Agreement" first. In distressed scenarios, the war is often between lenders (1st Lien vs. 2nd Lien) rather than lenders vs. borrowers.
