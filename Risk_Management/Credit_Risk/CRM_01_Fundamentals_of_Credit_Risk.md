# CRM 01: Fundamentals of Credit Risk

## 1. Introduction: What is Credit Risk?

**[Credit Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-risk)** is the [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of [financial loss](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-loss) arising from a [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) or [counterparty](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#counterparty-risk) failing to meet its contractual obligations, typically the failure to repay [principal](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#principal-loanbond) and/or [interest](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense) on a [debt instrument](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt). It is one of the oldest and most significant [risks](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) faced by [lenders](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor), investors in debt securities, and any entity that extends terms of trade (e.g., [accounts receivable](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#accounts-receivable-ar)).

**Core Elements:**
*   **Obligation:** There is a contractual promise by one party (obligor/[borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer)) to pay another party (obligee/[lender](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor)/[creditor](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#creditors-committee)).
*   **Failure ([Default](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk)):** The obligor does not fulfill this promise according to the agreed terms.
*   **[Financial Loss](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-loss):** The obligee suffers a monetary loss as a result of the failure.

Understanding and managing [credit risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-risk) is fundamental to the stability of individual [financial institutions](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-institutions) and the financial system as a whole.

## 2. Types of Credit Risk

[Credit risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-risk) can manifest in several ways:

*   **2.1. [Default Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk):**
    *   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) that a [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) will be unable or unwilling to make its required [debt](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) payments ([interest](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense) or [principal](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#principal-loanbond)) on time or in full. This is the most common form of [credit risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-risk).
    *   **Example:** A company misses an [interest](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense) payment on its [bond](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#bond) or fails to repay a [loan](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#loan-origination) at maturity.
*   **2.2. [Downgrade Risk (Credit Migration Risk)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#downgrade-risk-credit-migration-risk):**
    *   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) that a [borrower's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) [creditworthiness](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-rating) will deteriorate, leading to a downgrade in its [credit rating](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-rating) by [rating agencies](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-rating) (e.g., S&P, Moody's, Fitch) or an internal risk rating downgrade by a [lender](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor).
    *   **Impact:** While not a [default](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk), a downgrade typically increases the market yield required on the [borrower's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) [debt](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt), causing its market price to fall (for traded debt). It can also signal an increased [probability](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#probability) of future [default](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk) and may trigger certain clauses in loan agreements (e.g., increased interest rate).
    *   **Example:** A company rated 'BBB' is downgraded to 'BB' due to declining [profitability](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#profitability) and rising [leverage](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#leverage-financial).
*   **2.3. [Counterparty Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#counterparty-risk) ([Settlement Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#settlement-risk) - pre-settlement & settlement):**
    *   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) that the other party to a financial transaction (e.g., a [derivative contract](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#derivatives), a [foreign exchange](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#foreign-exchange-fx-risk--currency-risk) trade, a securities trade before settlement) will [default](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk) before the transaction is completed or on its obligations under the contract.
    *   **Pre-Settlement Risk:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of loss due to a [counterparty](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#counterparty-risk) defaulting on an obligation *before* the final settlement of a transaction. The loss is typically the cost of replacing the defaulted contract at current market prices. More significant for longer-dated, [over-the-counter (OTC)](../../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#otc-over-the-counter-market) [derivatives](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#derivatives).
    *   **[Settlement Risk (Herstatt Risk)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#settlement-risk):** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) that one party in a two-way transaction pays out the funds or delivers the [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets) it owes, but the [counterparty](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#counterparty-risk) defaults before fulfilling its part of the deal. This is most acute when payments are made in different time zones.
    *   **Example (Pre-Settlement):** A [bank](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#banks) has an interest rate swap with a corporation. The corporation goes bankrupt before the swap matures, and replacing the swap at current market rates results in a loss for the bank.
*   **2.4. [Concentration Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#concentration-risk):**
    *   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of loss arising from having a high exposure to a single [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer)/[counterparty](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#counterparty-risk), a group of connected counterparties, a specific industry sector, a geographic region, or a particular type of [collateral](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral).
    *   **Impact:** Lack of [diversification](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#diversification) means that a negative event affecting that concentrated exposure can lead to disproportionately large losses.
    *   **Example:** A [bank](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#banks) has 25% of its loan portfolio concentrated in the commercial real estate sector. A downturn in this sector could lead to significant credit losses for the bank.
*   **2.5. [Country Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#country-risk):**
    *   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of loss arising from operating or investing in a particular country, closely related to [sovereign risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#sovereign-risk). It includes the [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) that a sovereign government may be unwilling or unable to meet its [debt](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) obligations ([sovereign default risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#sovereign-risk)), or that it may impose [exchange controls](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#exchange-controls), [expropriate assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#expropriate), or that political/economic instability will harm investments.
    *   **Impact:** Can affect all entities operating within or exposed to that country.
    *   **Example:** A company has significant operations in a country that suddenly imposes [capital controls](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capital-controls), preventing the company from repatriating its [profits](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#profitability).

## 3. The [Five Cs of Credit](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#five-cs-of-credit) (Traditional Framework)

The "[Five Cs of Credit](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#five-cs-of-credit)" is a traditional, [qualitative](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#qualitative-analysis) framework used by [lenders](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor) to assess the [creditworthiness](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-rating) of a [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer). While more sophisticated [quantitative](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#quantitative-analysis) models exist, the principles remain highly relevant.

*   **3.1. [Character](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#character-five-cs-of-credit) (Willingness to Pay):**
    *   **Focus:** The [borrower's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) integrity, [reputation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#reputational-risk), track record of meeting obligations, and overall trustworthiness.
    *   **Assessment:** Reviewing payment history, credit reports, management's experience and [reputation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#reputational-risk), business ethics, and any history of [defaults](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk) or bankruptcies.
    *   *[Credit Analyst](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) Note:* Considered by many to be the most important "C". A [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) with strong capacity but poor character may still choose not to pay.
*   **3.2. [Capacity](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capacity-five-cs-of-credit) (Ability to Pay from [Operating Cash Flow](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo)):**
    *   **Focus:** The [borrower's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) ability to generate sufficient [cash flow](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) from its operations to service its [debt](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt) obligations ([interest](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-expense) and [principal](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#principal-loanbond)).
    *   **Assessment:** Analyzing historical and projected [financial statements](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-statements), particularly [cash flow statements](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#statement-of-cash-flows). Key metrics include [Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt-service-coverage-ratio-dscr), [Interest Coverage Ratio (TIE)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-coverage-ratio-times-interest-earned---tie), [Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#fixed-charge-coverage-ratio-fccr), and overall [profitability](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#profitability) and [cash flow](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) trends.
    *   *[Credit Analyst](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) Note:* This involves assessing the sustainability and quality of earnings and [cash flows](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo).
*   **3.3. [Capital](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#capital-five-cs-of-credit) (Financial Strength & [Net Worth](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#net-worth)):**
    *   **Focus:** The [borrower's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) financial position, [net worth](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#net-worth), and overall financial resilience. The amount of [equity](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity) or capital the owners have invested in the business.
    *   **Assessment:** Analyzing the [balance sheet](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet), particularly [leverage ratios](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#leverage-ratios) (e.g., Debt-to-Equity, Debt-to-Capital), [tangible net worth](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#tangible-net-worth), and the quality of [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets).
    *   *[Credit Analyst](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) Note:* A strong capital base provides a cushion to absorb losses and protect [creditors](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#creditors-committee).
*   **3.4. [Collateral](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral) (Secondary Source of Repayment):**
    *   **Focus:** [Assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets) pledged by the [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) to secure the [loan](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#loan-origination), which the [lender](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor) can claim in the event of [default](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk).
    *   **Assessment:** Evaluating the type, quality, value (market value, [liquidation value](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#liquidation-value)), and [liquidity](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#liquidity) of the [collateral](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral). Ensuring the [lender](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor) has a perfected [security interest](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#security-interest) (legal claim).
    *   *[Credit Analyst](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) Note:* While important, [collateral](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral) is a secondary source of repayment. [Lenders](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor) prefer to be repaid from [cash flow](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo), not by seizing and selling [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets).
*   **3.5. [Conditions](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#conditions-five-cs-of-credit) (Economic & Industry Environment):**
    *   **Focus:** The external economic and industry conditions that may affect the [borrower's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) ability to repay.
    *   **Assessment:** Analyzing the overall economic outlook ([GDP](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#gdp-gross-domestic-product) growth, [inflation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#inflation), [interest rates](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk)), industry trends, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, and any specific conditions impacting the [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) or the [loan](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#loan-origination) (e.g., purpose of the loan).
    *   *[Credit Analyst](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) Note:* This involves understanding cyclical factors, industry-specific [risks](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk), and how the [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) is positioned to navigate these conditions.

## 4. Overview of the [Credit Lifecycle](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-lifecycle)

The management of [credit risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-risk) typically follows a lifecycle approach:

*   **4.1. [Origination](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#loan-origination) & Business Development:**
    *   Identifying potential [borrowers](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) that meet the [lender's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#lendercreditor) target market and [risk appetite](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk-appetite).
    *   Initial discussions and gathering of preliminary information.
*   **4.2. [Underwriting](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#underwriting-securities) & [Due Diligence](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#due-diligence):**
    *   The core [credit analysis](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) process. Involves detailed [financial analysis](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-analysis), industry assessment, management evaluation, [collateral](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral) appraisal (if any), and overall [risk assessment](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk-assessment) (as outlined by the [Five Cs](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#five-cs-of-credit) and other frameworks).
    *   (See `CRM_02_Credit_Analysis_Process_and_Tools.md` for details).
*   **4.3. Credit Approval & Structuring:**
    *   Based on the [underwriting](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#underwriting-securities), a credit decision is made (approve, decline, or approve with modifications).
    *   If approved, the [loan](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#loan-origination) is structured with appropriate terms, conditions, pricing, [covenants](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#covenant), and [security](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#security-interest).
*   **4.4. Documentation & Closing:**
    *   Legal documentation of the loan agreement and any [security interests](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#security-interest).
    *   Fulfillment of [conditions precedent](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#conditions-precedent-cps) before [funding](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#funding-liquidity-risk).
*   **4.5. [Monitoring](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk-monitoring) & [Portfolio Management](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management):**
    *   Ongoing review of the [borrower's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) financial performance, compliance with [covenants](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#covenant), and changes in its business or industry.
    *   Regular [risk rating](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-rating) updates.
    *   Management of the overall [credit portfolio](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-portfolio-management-cpm) to control [concentrations](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#concentration-risk) and optimize risk-return.
*   **4.6. [Problem Loan Management](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#problem-loan-management) & [Workout](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#workout-loan-workout)/[Recovery](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#recovery-rate):**
    *   If a [borrower](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#issuer) shows signs of [financial distress](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-distress) or [defaults](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#default-risk), this stage involves strategies to minimize losses.
    *   May include [forbearance](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#forbearance-agreement), [loan restructuring](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt-restructuring), [workout](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#workout-loan-workout) plans, or, as a last resort, legal action, [collateral](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral) seizure, and [recovery](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#recovery-rate) efforts.
    *   (To be detailed in `CRM_05_Problem_Loan_Management_and_Workout.md`).
