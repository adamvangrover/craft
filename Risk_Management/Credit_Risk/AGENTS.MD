# Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this directory.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the overall repository structure and the style of other Risk Management sections.
*   **Clarity and Detail:** Credit risk concepts should be explained thoroughly, with practical examples where possible.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Utilize Markdown effectively.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all definitions, processes (e.g., Five Cs, credit analysis steps), and methodologies are accurate and reflect sound credit risk management principles.
*   **File Naming:** Follow the `CRM_XX_TopicName.md` convention.
*   **Links:** Use relative links. Verify functionality. Link key terms to `Global_Financial_Glossary.md` and relevant concepts in `CFA/`, `Financial_Modeling/`, and `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/`.
*   **Updating Navigation:** When adding new content:
    *   Update `Risk_Management/Credit_Risk/README.md` (the "Structure of This Sub-Section" list).
    *   Update `Risk_Management/Credit_Risk/index.html` (`filesInDir` JavaScript array).
    *   Notify or update `Risk_Management/README.md` and `Risk_Management/index.html` (main hub for Risk Management).
*   **Review:** Adhere to guidelines and task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Credit Risk Management

### Inherits From
This document inherits from `Risk_Management/AGENTS.MD` and root `AGENTS.MD`. Review those first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This `/Risk_Management/Credit_Risk/` subdirectory is dedicated to a focused exploration of Credit Risk, covering fundamentals, analysis processes, measurement tools, and management techniques.

The main guide for this subdirectory is `Risk_Management/Credit_Risk/README.md`.
Individual topic documents are `CRM_XX_*.md` files.
Navigation is supported by `Risk_Management/Credit_Risk/index.html`.

### 2. Content Structure for Credit Risk Documents
Each `CRM_XX_*.md` file should:
*   Clearly define its specific topic within credit risk.
*   Provide detailed explanations, frameworks (e.g., Five Cs), process steps, or methodologies.
*   Use examples to illustrate concepts.
*   Include "Key Takeaways" or a summary.
*   Where appropriate, discuss the relevance for different roles (e.g., analyst, underwriter, portfolio manager).

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Content
*   **Practical Application:** Emphasize how these concepts are used in real-world credit assessment and decision-making.
*   **Integration with Other Areas:** Highlight connections to financial statement analysis (FSA), financial modeling, industry analysis, and economic conditions.
*   **Credit Lifecycle Context:** Frame topics within the broader credit lifecycle (origination, underwriting, monitoring, workout).
*   **Placeholder Content:** Clearly mark planned but undeveloped sections (e.g., `CRM_04`, `CRM_05` as noted in the README).

### 4. Development Notes
*   The `README.md` outlines planned future documents (`CRM_04`, `CRM_05`). Development of these is a priority.
*   Ensure strong alignment and cross-referencing with the `/corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/` program, as there's significant conceptual overlap. This section can serve as a more detailed, evergreen reference.

Refer to parent `AGENTS.MD` files for broader Risk Management and repository guidelines.
