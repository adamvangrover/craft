# Credit Risk Management

## Welcome to the Credit Risk Management Sub-Section

This sub-section within the broader Risk Management framework is dedicated to a focused exploration of **Credit Risk**. Credit risk is one of the most significant risks faced by financial institutions and is a core area of concern for any entity that extends credit or invests in debt instruments.

A deep understanding of credit risk, its drivers, assessment methodologies, and management techniques is fundamental for credit analysts, portfolio managers, risk managers, and other finance professionals.

## Purpose & Scope

The primary objectives of this sub-section are to:

1.  **Define and Categorize Credit Risk:** Clearly explain what credit risk entails and its various forms (e.g., default risk, downgrade risk, counterparty risk, concentration risk).
2.  **Outline the Credit Lifecycle:** Cover the key stages from origination and underwriting through monitoring and to workout/recovery.
3.  **Detail the Credit Analysis Process:** Provide a structured approach to assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers (corporates, individuals, sovereigns).
4.  **Explore Credit Risk Measurement Tools:** Discuss financial statement analysis, ratio analysis, cash flow modeling, credit scoring, and rating models.
5.  **Discuss Credit Risk Mitigation & Management:** Cover techniques like collateral, covenants, guarantees, diversification, and credit derivatives (at a conceptual level).
6.  **Connect to Broader Risk Frameworks:** Show how credit risk management integrates with an organization's overall enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy.
