# CRM 02: Credit Analysis Process and Tools

## 1. Introduction to the Credit Analysis Process

The **Credit Analysis Process** is a systematic approach undertaken by lenders and investors to evaluate the creditworthiness of a potential borrower or debt issuer. Its primary goal is to determine the likelihood that the borrower will meet its debt obligations (principal and interest) in full and on time, and to assess the potential loss if default occurs.

This process is both an art and a science, requiring quantitative analysis of financial data, qualitative assessment of business and management factors, and sound professional judgment. It forms the basis for making informed credit decisions, structuring loan agreements, and pricing risk.

## 2. Key Steps in the Credit Analysis Process

While the specifics may vary by institution and the complexity of the credit, a comprehensive credit analysis process generally involves the following key steps:

**Step 1: Determine the Purpose of the Loan & Sources of Repayment**
*   **Understand the "Why":** Why is the borrower seeking funds? (e.g., working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition, refinancing, dividend recapitalization). The purpose can significantly influence the risk profile.
*   **Identify Primary Source of Repayment:** This is almost always the borrower's operating cash flow. The analysis must confirm the capacity to generate sufficient cash.
*   **Identify Secondary Sources of Repayment:**
    *   Sale/liquidation of collateral (for secured loans).
    *   Refinancing with another lender or in capital markets.
    *   Sale of non-core assets.
*   **Identify Tertiary Sources of Repayment (if any):**
    *   Guarantees (from parent company, individuals, or government agencies).
    *   Equity cures or capital injections from owners/sponsors.
*   *Credit Analyst Note:* A clear understanding of repayment sources from the outset frames the entire analysis. Reliance on secondary or tertiary sources implies higher risk.

**Step 2: Borrower and Industry Analysis (Qualitative Assessment)**
*   **Business Profile:**
    *   Nature of operations, products/services, history, legal structure.
    *   Competitive advantages, market position, brand strength.
    *   Operational efficiency, supply chain, technology.
    *   (Refer to `Toolkits_and_Checklists/Credit_Analysis_Due_Diligence_Checklist.md` - Section I & II).
*   **Industry Analysis:**
    *   Industry structure, trends, growth prospects, cyclicality.
    *   Competitive dynamics (e.g., Porter's Five Forces).
    *   Regulatory environment.
    *   Macroeconomic influences.
    *   (Refer to Industry Primers and `Risk_Management/02_Risk_Identification_and_Assessment_Frameworks.md`).
*   **Management Assessment:**
    *   Experience, track record, integrity, and depth of the management team.
    *   Clarity of strategy and ability to execute.
    *   Financial philosophy (e.g., attitude towards leverage, dividend policy).
    *   Succession planning.
    *   Ownership structure and alignment of interests.

**Step 3: In-Depth Financial Statement Analysis**
*   **Historical Financial Review (typically 3-5 years + interims):**
    *   Spreading financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement).
    *   Trend analysis: Examining growth rates, margin changes, and shifts in financial structure over time.
    *   Common-size analysis: Expressing IS items as % of revenue, BS items as % of total assets to identify structural changes and facilitate comparisons.
*   **Ratio Analysis:** Calculating and interpreting key financial ratios across categories:
    *   **Liquidity:** Current, Quick, Cash ratios, CCC (DSO, DIH, DPO).
    *   **Solvency/Leverage:** Debt/Equity, Debt/Capital, Debt/Assets, Debt/EBITDA.
    *   **Coverage:** TIE, EBITDA Coverage, FCCR, DSCR.
    *   **Profitability:** Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, ROA, ROE.
    *   **Activity/Efficiency:** Asset Turnover, Inventory Turnover.
    *   (Refer to `CFA/Level_1/Cheat_Sheets/CS_FSA_Key_Ratios_for_Credit_Analysts.md` and `Toolkits_and_Checklists/Basic_Financial_Ratios_Calculator_Guide.md`).
*   **Quality of Earnings (QoE) Assessment:**
    *   Identifying and adjusting for non-recurring items.
    *   Scrutinizing revenue and expense recognition policies.
    *   Analyzing discretionary spending and reserves.
*   **Footnote Analysis:** Critical for understanding accounting policies, debt terms, commitments, contingencies, segment data, etc.

**Step 4: Cash Flow Analysis and Projections**
*   **Historical Cash Flow Analysis:**
    *   Detailed review of CFO, CFI, and CFF.
    *   Assessing the quality and sustainability of CFO.
    *   Understanding investment patterns (CapEx) and financing activities.
    *   (Refer to `CFA/Level_1/Topic_Deep_Dives/FSA_Cash_Flow_Statement_Analysis_for_Creditors.md`).
*   **Financial Projections (Forecasts):**
    *   Developing a base case financial forecast (typically 3-5 years) for the IS, BS, and CFS.
    *   Assumptions should be well-documented and justified (see `Financial_Modeling/Forecasting_Techniques/Revenue_Forecasting_Approaches.md`).
    *   Projections are used to forecast future credit ratios and debt service capacity.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Analysis:**
    *   Projecting FCFF and/or FCFE to assess cash available for debt service and other stakeholders.
    *   (Refer to `Financial_Modeling/Valuation_Applications/DCF_Modeling_Overview.md` for FCF concepts).

**Step 5: Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis (Stress Testing)**
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Testing the impact of changes in key individual assumptions (e.g., revenue growth, interest rates, key input costs) on financial projections and credit metrics.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Developing plausible alternative scenarios (e.g., recession, loss of a major customer, sharp rise in input costs) and modeling their impact.
*   *Credit Analyst Note:* This is crucial for understanding downside risk and the resilience of the borrower's repayment capacity.

**Step 6: Management & Ownership Assessment (Deeper Dive)**
*   Beyond the initial overview, delve deeper into management's credibility, experience relevant to current challenges, and their responses during due diligence.
*   For privately-owned companies, understand the owners' financial capacity, commitment to the business, and potential willingness to provide support if needed.

**Step 7: Loan Structuring & Collateral (If Applicable)**
*   **Loan Structure:** Determining the appropriate type of facility (e.g., revolver, term loan), amount, tenor, repayment schedule, and pricing (interest rate, fees).
*   **Collateral:** If a secured loan, assessing the value, quality, and liquidity of pledged assets. (Refer to Due Diligence Checklist - Section V).
*   **Covenants:** Designing appropriate financial, affirmative, and negative covenants to protect the lender's interests and provide early warning signals. (See `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/modules/03-the-analysts-craft/` for more on covenants, and future `CRM_04` document).

**Step 8: Making a Credit Recommendation & Documentation**
*   **Synthesize Findings:** Summarize all qualitative and quantitative analysis.
*   **Identify Key Risks & Mitigants.**
*   **Formulate a Credit Recommendation:** Approve, decline, or approve with specific conditions/modifications. Justify the recommendation clearly.
*   **Prepare Credit Memorandum (Credit Application/Report):** A formal document outlining the analysis, findings, and recommendation for presentation to a credit committee or decision-maker. (See `corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/modules/03-the-analysts-craft/05-business-writing-and-grammar.md`).
