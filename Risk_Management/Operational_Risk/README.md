# Operational Risk Management

## Welcome to the Operational Risk Management Sub-Section

This part of the Risk Management framework is dedicated to **Operational Risk**. Operational risk is defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as "the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events." This definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk.

Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and is one of the most diverse and challenging risk types to manage. It covers a wide spectrum of potential issues, from human error and internal fraud to system failures, cyberattacks, and natural disasters.

## Purpose & Scope

The objectives of this sub-section are to:

1.  **Define Operational Risk:** Clearly explain its components and distinguish it from other risk types.
2.  **Categorize Operational Risk Events:** Introduce common taxonomies for classifying operational loss events.
3.  **Outline Key Frameworks & Tools:** Discuss approaches to identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring, and mitigating operational risks.
4.  **Emphasize the Role of Internal Controls:** Highlight the importance of a strong control environment.
5.  **Connect to Overall Risk Management:** Show how operational risk management integrates into an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program.

## Structure of This Sub-Section

This "Operational Risk" area will be developed with the following core documents, with potential for more specialized deep dives later:

*   **[ORM_01_Introduction_to_Operational_Risk.md](./ORM_01_Introduction_to_Operational_Risk.md):**
    *   Defining operational risk (Basel definition).
    *   Key categories of operational risk events (e.g., internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products, and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; execution, delivery, and process management).
    *   Sources of operational risk (people, processes, systems, external events).
    *   Importance of operational risk management.
    *   Introduction to Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and Loss Event Data Collection.
    *   The role of internal controls (briefly linking to frameworks like COSO).
*   **[ORM_02_Operational_Risk_Management_Framework_and_Tools.md](./ORM_02_Operational_Risk_Management_Framework_and_Tools.md):** *(Future Addition)*
    *   Risk Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs).
    *   Mapping processes and identifying control points.
    *   Scenario Analysis for operational risk.
    *   Business Process Improvement (BPI) as a risk mitigator.
    *   Role of technology in managing operational risk.
*   **[ORM_03_Business_Continuity_and_Disaster_Recovery_Planning.md](./ORM_03_Business_Continuity_and_Disaster_Recovery_Planning.md):** *(Future Addition)*
    *   Importance of BCP/DRP.
    *   Key components: Business Impact Analysis (BIA), recovery strategies, plan development, testing, and maintenance.
*   **[ORM_04_Cybersecurity_and_IT_Risk_as_Operational_Risk.md](./ORM_04_Cybersecurity_and_IT_Risk_as_Operational_Risk.md):** *(Future Addition)*
    *   Specific focus on IT and cybersecurity risks as a major component of operational risk. (Can link to `Fintech/Cybersecurity_in_Fintech.md`).

## How to Use This Sub-Section

*   **Foundation:** `ORM_01_Introduction_to_Operational_Risk.md` provides the essential definitions and categories.
*   **Credit Analyst Application:**
    *   When analyzing a company (borrower or counterparty), its operational resilience is a key credit factor. Significant operational failures can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and even bankruptcy.
    *   Look for disclosures about operational risk management practices, history of significant operational losses, investments in systems, and business continuity plans.
    *   Industries with complex processes or heavy reliance on technology (e.g., manufacturing, logistics, financial services themselves) may have higher inherent operational risk.
*   **Broader Risk Perspective:** Understanding operational risk is crucial for anyone involved in managing any aspect of a business, as it permeates all activities.

This section will provide a structured approach to understanding and managing operational risk. Contributions, particularly case studies of operational failures and best practices in mitigation, are welcome.
