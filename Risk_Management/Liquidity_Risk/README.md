# Liquidity Risk Management

## Overview

This section provides an introduction to Liquidity Risk, a critical risk category for financial institutions and corporations. Liquidity risk refers to the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its short-term financial obligations as they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.

*(Placeholder for detailed content. This section will cover the types of liquidity risk (funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk), causes, measurement, and management strategies.)*

## Key Concepts

*   **Funding Liquidity Risk:** The risk that an entity will not be able to meet its obligations as they come due because it cannot obtain sufficient funding (e.g., roll over maturing debt, access new loans or deposits, or meet margin calls) at a reasonable cost or at all.
*   **Market Liquidity Risk (Asset Liquidity Risk):** The risk that an entity cannot easily offset or eliminate a position at the market price because of inadequate market depth or market disruption. It is the risk of being unable to sell an asset quickly without a significant price concession.
*   **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):** (Banking/Basel III) A regulatory requirement for banks to hold a sufficient stock of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period.
*   **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):** (Banking/Basel III) A longer-term structural ratio designed to ensure that banks have a stable funding structure to support their long-term assets and activities.
*   **Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR):** A measure of the maximum expected shortfall in cash flow over a given period at a certain confidence level.

## Causes of Liquidity Risk

*   Unexpected large withdrawals of deposits (for banks).
*   Inability to roll over maturing debt.
*   Sudden drying up of funding markets.
*   Large, unexpected operational losses or market losses.
*   Rating downgrades leading to loss of market access or collateral calls.
*   Inability to sell assets quickly without large discounts.

## Management of Liquidity Risk

*   Maintaining a stock of high-quality liquid assets.
*   Diversifying funding sources.
*   Managing liability maturity profiles.
*   Contingency funding plans (CFPs).
*   Stress testing liquidity positions.
*   Setting internal limits on liquidity risk exposures.
