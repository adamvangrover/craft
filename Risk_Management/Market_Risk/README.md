# Market Risk Management

## Welcome to the Market Risk Management Sub-Section

This sub-section of the Risk Management framework focuses on **Market Risk**. Market risk is the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions arising from adverse movements in market prices. This includes risks associated with interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and commodity prices.

While credit risk often takes center stage for many lending institutions, market risk is a critical concern for:
*   Institutions with trading books.
*   Asset managers and investment funds.
*   Treasury functions managing interest rate and FX exposures.
*   Any company whose earnings or asset values are sensitive to market fluctuations.
*   Credit analysts assessing companies that are significantly exposed to market variables (e.g., commodity producers, multinational corporations with FX exposures, companies with large defined benefit pension plans holding marketable securities).

## Purpose & Scope

The objectives of this sub-section are to:

1.  **Define and Categorize Market Risk:** Explain the different types of market risk and their sources.
2.  **Introduce Measurement Concepts:** Discuss basic and more advanced techniques for quantifying market risk exposure (e.g., Duration, Convexity, Beta, Value at Risk - VaR, Stress Testing).
3.  **Outline Management & Hedging Strategies:** Explore how market risks can be managed through asset-liability management (ALM), diversification, and the use of derivative instruments.
4.  **Connect to Overall Risk Framework:** Show how market risk fits into an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program.

## Structure of This Sub-Section

This "Market Risk" area will be developed with the following core documents, with potential for more specialized deep dives later:

*   **[MRM_01_Introduction_to_Market_Risk.md](./MRM_01_Introduction_to_Market_Risk.md):**
    *   Defining market risk.
    *   Key categories:
        *   **Interest Rate Risk:** Impact of changing interest rates on asset/liability values and net interest income.
        *   **Equity Price Risk:** Impact of changing equity prices on investments.
        *   **Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk:** Impact of changing FX rates on international operations and investments (transaction, translation, economic exposure).
        *   **Commodity Price Risk:** Impact of changing commodity prices on producers, consumers, and investors.
    *   Sources of market risk (e.g., volatility, market liquidity, asset-liability mismatches).
    *   Basic measurement concepts (sensitivity measures like Duration and Beta).
    *   Introduction to Value at Risk (VaR) – concept, methods (briefly), and limitations.
*   **[MRM_02_Measuring_Market_Risk_VaR_and_Stress_Testing.md](./MRM_02_Measuring_Market_Risk_VaR_and_Stress_Testing.md):** *(Future Addition)*
    *   Detailed look at Value at Risk (VaR) methodologies (Parametric, Historical Simulation, Monte Carlo).
    *   Backtesting VaR models.
    *   Limitations of VaR.
    *   Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis for market risk.
    *   Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR).
*   **[MRM_03_Managing_Market_Risk_Hedging_and_ALM.md](./MRM_03_Managing_Market_Risk_Hedging_and_ALM.md):** *(Future Addition)*
    *   Asset-Liability Management (ALM) techniques.
    *   Using derivatives for hedging market risks (forwards, futures, options, swaps – conceptual application).
    *   Setting market risk limits and controls.
*   **[MRM_04_Specific_Market_Risks_Deep_Dive.md](./MRM_04_Specific_Market_Risks_Deep_Dive.md):** *(Future Addition)*
    *   More detailed exploration of interest rate risk (e.g., repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, option risk).
    *   In-depth look at FX risk management.

## How to Use This Sub-Section

*   **Foundation:** Start with `MRM_01_Introduction_to_Market_Risk.md` for core definitions and concepts.
*   **Credit Analyst Application:** While direct market risk modeling might be less frequent for corporate credit analysts, understanding how market risks impact your borrowers is crucial. For example:
    *   How does interest rate volatility affect a company with significant floating-rate debt?
    *   How does FX volatility impact an exporter or importer?
    *   How might a sharp fall in equity markets affect a company's ability to raise capital or the value of its pension assets?
*   **Broader Risk Perspective:** For those in treasury, asset management, or broader risk roles, the subsequent modules on measurement and management will be key.

This section aims to provide a clear and practical understanding of market risk. Contributions are welcome, especially practical examples and case studies.

## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **Populate Future Content:** The highest priority is developing the planned `MRM_02`, `MRM_03`, and `MRM_04` documents covering VaR, Stress Testing, Hedging, ALM, and deeper dives into specific market risks.
*   **Quantitative Examples:** Market risk is often quantitative. Include clear numerical examples for concepts like duration, VaR calculations (simplified initially), and hedging effectiveness.
*   **Interactive Notebook Integration:** This area is ripe for linking to or developing interactive notebooks in `Interactive_Notebooks/Risk_Management/` or `Interactive_Notebooks/Market_Analysis/` for concepts like:
    *   VaR calculation (as planned in `Interactive_Notebooks/Risk_Management/README.md`).
    *   Visualizing interest rate risk impacts.
    *   Simulating simple hedging strategies.
*   **Real-World Illustrations:** Brief examples of how market events (e.g., sudden interest rate changes, FX volatility) have impacted companies or financial institutions.

## Student & Teacher Notes

*   **Students:**
    *   Focus on understanding the *sources* of each type of market risk first.
    *   For measures like duration and VaR, understand not just the calculation but also the *interpretation and limitations*.
    *   Connect market risk concepts to the news; try to identify how current events might be creating market risks for different entities.
    *   Credit analysts should focus on how a company's exposure to market risks (and its strategies for managing them) can affect its cash flows, profitability, and overall creditworthiness.
*   **Teachers:**
    *   Use current market events as case studies to discuss different types of market risk.
    *   Emphasize the assumptions behind different risk measures (e.g., normality assumption in parametric VaR).
    *   Discuss the evolution of market risk management practices, particularly post-GFC.

## Possible Avenues for Exploration and Further Development

*   **Advanced Market Risk Models:** Beyond basic VaR, conceptual introductions to Expected Shortfall (ES), advanced stress testing techniques, and different types of Monte Carlo simulations.
*   **Specific Derivative Hedging Strategies:** Detailed examples of using forwards, futures, options, and swaps to hedge specific market exposures.
*   **Asset-Liability Management (ALM) Case Studies:** For banks or insurance companies.
*   **Regulatory Capital for Market Risk:** Overview of Basel framework requirements for market risk (e.g., Fundamental Review of the Trading Book - FRTB concepts, simplified).
*   **Market Risk in Non-Financial Corporations:** How industrial companies manage FX and commodity risks.
