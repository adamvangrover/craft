# MRM 01: Introduction to Market Risk

## 1. Defining Market Risk

**[Market Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#market-risk)** is the [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of [financial loss](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-loss) resulting from adverse movements in market prices or rates. These movements can impact the value of on-[balance sheet](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets) and [liabilities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#liabilities), as well as [off-balance sheet](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#off-balance-sheet-financing-obsf) positions (like [derivatives](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#derivatives)). [Market risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#market-risk) is inherent in any activity involving trading, investing, or holding [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets) whose values fluctuate with market conditions.

It is distinct from [credit risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-risk) (which relates to an obligor's failure to perform), but the two can be interconnected (e.g., a market downturn can increase [credit risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-risk)).

**Key Characteristics:**
*   Arises from [volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility) in financial market variables.
*   Can impact a wide range of instruments and [portfolios](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management).
*   Often assessed using statistical measures and models.

## 2. Key Categories of Market Risk

[Market risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#market-risk) is typically broken down into several major categories:

**2.1. [Interest Rate Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk):**
*   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of loss due to adverse changes in market [interest rates](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk). This is one of the most significant market [risks](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) for many [financial institutions](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-institutions) and [fixed-income](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#fixed-income) investors.
*   **Impacts:**
    *   **Value of [Fixed-Income Securities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#fixed-income):** [Bond prices](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#bond) generally move inversely to [interest rates](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk). Rising rates decrease the value of existing fixed-rate [bonds](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#bond).
    *   **[Net Interest Margin (NIM)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#net-interest-margin-nim) / Net Interest Income (NII) for [Banks](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#banks):** Changes in rates can affect the spread between what a [bank](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#banks) earns on its [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets) ([loans](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#loan-origination), securities) and what it pays on its [liabilities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#liabilities) (deposits, borrowings). This is often analyzed through concepts like:
        *   **[Repricing Risk (Gap Risk)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#repricing-risk-gap-risk):** Mismatches in the timing of when [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#assets) and [liabilities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#liabilities) reprice to new market rates.
        *   **[Basis Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#basis-risk):** Imperfect [correlation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#correlation-vs-causation) in the adjustment of rates earned and paid on different instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics.
        *   **[Yield Curve Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#yield-curve-risk):** Non-parallel shifts in the [yield curve](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#yield-curve) can affect different parts of a [portfolio](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management) differently.
        *   **[Option Risk (Embedded Options)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#option-risk-embedded-options):** Options like [loan prepayments](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#prepayment-risk) or [bond callability](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#callable-bond) can alter [cash flows](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) and [valuations](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#valuation) as rates change.
    *   **[Cost of Borrowing](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cost-of-debt-kd):** For corporations, rising rates increase the cost of new [debt](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt).
*   **Basic Measurement (Level 1 CFA concepts):**
    *   **[Duration (Macaulay, Modified, Effective)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#duration-bond-duration):** Measures the sensitivity of a [bond's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#bond) price to changes in [interest rates](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk). Higher duration means greater price [volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility) for a given rate change.
    *   **[Convexity](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#convexity-bond-convexity):** Measures the curvature of the price-yield relationship for a [bond](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#bond), providing a second-order adjustment to duration-based price estimates.

**2.2. [Equity Price Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity-price-risk):**
*   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of loss due to adverse changes in the prices of [equity securities (stocks)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#equity).
*   **Impacts:**
    *   Value of equity [portfolios](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management) held by investors or institutions.
    *   Value of [equity-linked derivatives](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#derivatives).
    *   Company [valuations](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#valuation) and [market capitalization](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#market-capitalization-market-cap).
*   **[Systematic Risk (Market Risk)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#systematic-risk-market-risk--non-diversifiable-risk):** [Volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility) due to overall market movements, measured by **[Beta (Î²)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#beta-)**. Beta indicates how a stock's price tends to move relative to a broad [market index](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#benchmark) (e.g., S&P 500).
    *   `Beta = 1`: Stock moves in line with the market.
    *   `Beta > 1`: Stock is more volatile than the market.
    *   `Beta < 1`: Stock is less volatile than the market.
*   **[Idiosyncratic Risk (Specific Risk)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#idiosyncratic-risk-specific-risk):** [Volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility) due to company-specific factors, which can theoretically be [diversified](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#diversification) away in a large [portfolio](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management).

**2.3. [Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk / Currency Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#foreign-exchange-fx-risk--currency-risk):**
*   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of loss due to adverse movements in foreign exchange rates.
*   **Impacts:**
    *   **[Transaction Exposure](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#transaction-exposure-fx-risk):** Affects the value of contractual [cash flows](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) denominated in foreign currencies (e.g., a UK company selling goods to a US customer in USD faces FX risk until the USD receivable is converted to GBP).
    *   **[Translation Exposure (Accounting Exposure)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#translation-exposure-fx-risk):** Affects the reported [financial statements](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-statements) ([balance sheet](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#balance-sheet) and [income statement](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#income-statement-profit--loss-or-pl)) of companies with foreign subsidiaries when their foreign currency financials are translated back into the [parent company's](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#holding-company) [reporting currency](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#reporting-currency). This is an accounting impact, not necessarily a direct [cash flow](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) impact.
    *   **[Economic Exposure (Operating Exposure)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#economic-exposure-operating-exposure):** Affects a company's long-term competitiveness and value due to unexpected changes in exchange rates impacting future [cash flows](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo) (e.g., a domestic company facing cheaper imports due to a stronger domestic currency).
*   *[Credit Analyst](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) Note:* For companies with significant international operations or FX-denominated [debt](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt), understanding their FX risk exposure and [hedging](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#hedging) strategies is crucial.

**2.4. [Commodity Price Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#commodity-price-risk):**
*   **Definition:** The [risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk) of loss due to adverse movements in the prices of [commodities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#commodities) (e.g., oil, gas, metals, agricultural products).
*   **Impacts:**
    *   **Producers:** Lower prices reduce revenues and [profitability](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#profitability).
    *   **Consumers/Users:** Higher prices increase input costs.
    *   **[Investors](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#investors):** Affects the value of commodity-linked investments or [derivatives](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#derivatives).
*   *[Credit Analyst](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) Note:* Crucial for analyzing companies in commodity-producing or commodity-intensive industries.

## 3. Sources of Market Risk

*   **Economic Factors:** [GDP](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#gross-domestic-product-gdp) growth, [inflation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#inflation), unemployment, [fiscal policy](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#fiscal-policy) and [monetary policy](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#monetary-policy).
*   **Political & Geopolitical Events:** Elections, wars, trade disputes, political instability.
*   **[Market Sentiment](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#market-sentiment) & [Investor Behavior](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#investor-sentiment):** "Animal spirits," [risk aversion](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk-aversion) levels, [herding behavior](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#herding-behavior). (Links to [Behavioral Finance](../../Behavioral_Finance/README.md)).
*   **[Market Liquidity](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#market-liquidity):** The ease with which an [asset](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#asset) can be bought or sold without significantly affecting its price. [Illiquid](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#illiquidity) markets can exacerbate price [volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility) and make it difficult to exit positions.
*   **Company-Specific News (for Equity/Debt):** [Earnings announcements](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#earnings-call), [M&A activity](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#mergers--acquisitions-ma), management changes (can become market risk if it affects a large, systemic player or a whole sector).
*   **Natural Disasters & Other External Shocks:** Can impact specific [commodities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#commodities), industries, or overall economic activity.

## 4. Basic Measurement Concepts for Market Risk

While detailed measurement models are complex (covered in future modules), some basic concepts are foundational:

*   **[Sensitivity Measures](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#sensitivity-analysis):**
    *   **[Duration (Interest Rate Risk)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#duration-bond-duration):** As described above, measures price sensitivity to [yield](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#yield) changes.
    *   **[Beta (Equity Price Risk)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#beta-):** As described above, measures sensitivity to market movements.
    *   **["Greeks" (for Options)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#greeks-options):** [Delta](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#delta-options) (sensitivity to underlying price), [Gamma](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#gamma-options) (sensitivity of Delta), [Vega](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#vega-options) (sensitivity to [volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility)), [Theta](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#theta-options) (sensitivity to time decay), [Rho](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#rho-options) (sensitivity to [interest rates](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk)). (More advanced, but Delta is a key Level 1 [derivatives](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#derivatives) concept).
*   **[Volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility):** Statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or [market index](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#benchmark), often measured by [standard deviation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#standard-deviation) or [variance](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#variance). Higher [volatility](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#volatility) implies greater market risk.
*   **[Correlation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#correlation):** Measures the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. Understanding [correlations](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#correlation) between different [assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#asset) is crucial for [portfolio diversification](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#diversification).

## 5. Introduction to [Value at Risk (VaR)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#value-at-risk-var)

**5.1. Concept:**
*   **[Value at Risk (VaR)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#value-at-risk-var)** is a widely used statistical technique to measure the maximum potential [loss](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-loss) that a [portfolio](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management) (of [financial assets](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-asset)) is likely to suffer over a specific time horizon, at a given [confidence level](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#confidence-interval), under normal market conditions.
*   **It answers the question:** "What is the most I can expect to lose (with X% probability) over the next Y days?"
*   **Example:** "A [portfolio](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management) has a 1-day 99% VaR of $1 million." This means there is a 1% chance that the [portfolio](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management) will lose more than $1 million in a single day, assuming normal market conditions. (Or, we are 99% confident that losses will not exceed $1 million in one day).

**5.2. Key Parameters of VaR:**
*   **Time Horizon:** The period over which the potential [loss](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-loss) is measured (e.g., 1 day, 10 days). Shorter for trading books, longer for [investment portfolios](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management).
*   **[Confidence Level](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#confidence-interval):** The probability that losses will *not* exceed the VaR amount (e.g., 95%, 99%). Higher [confidence level](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#confidence-interval) means a higher VaR figure.
*   **Base Currency:** The currency in which VaR is expressed.

**5.3. Common VaR Calculation Methods (Brief Overview - More in MRM_02):**
*   **[Parametric Method (Variance-Covariance Method)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#parametric-var-variance-covariance-method):** Assumes returns are normally distributed and uses historical data to estimate mean, [variance](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#variance), and [correlations](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#correlation).
*   **[Historical Simulation Method](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#historical-simulation-var):** Uses actual historical price changes to simulate potential future [portfolio P&L](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#profit--loss-statement-pl). Does not assume normal distribution.
*   **[Monte Carlo Simulation Method](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#monte-carlo-simulation):** Uses computer modeling to generate many random price paths for [portfolio](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#portfolio-management) components based on specified statistical properties and [correlations](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#correlation).

**5.4. Limitations of VaR:**
*   **Does Not Measure "Worst-Case" [Loss](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-loss):** VaR tells you the maximum [loss](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-loss) *up to* the [confidence level](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#confidence-interval). It doesn't say how bad losses could be *beyond* that point (in the "[tail](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#tail-risk)" of the distribution).
*   **Assumption of Normality (for Parametric VaR):** [Financial returns](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#return) often exhibit "[fat tails](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#fat-tails)" (more extreme events than a normal distribution would suggest), meaning parametric VaR can underestimate [tail risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#tail-risk).
*   **Historical Data Dependence:** [Historical simulation](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#historical-simulation-var) relies on past data being representative of the future, which may not hold during market regime shifts or unprecedented events ([black swan events](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#black-swan-event)).
*   **Can Be Misleading if Misunderstood:** VaR is an estimate, not a guarantee.
*   **Does Not Capture [Liquidity Risk](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#liquidity-risk) Well:** Assumes positions can be liquidated at prevailing market prices.

Despite limitations, VaR is a standard tool for market risk measurement, reporting, and setting [risk limits](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#risk-limits), especially in regulated [financial institutions](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-institutions). It is often supplemented with [Stress Testing](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#stress-testing) and [Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR)](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#expected-shortfall-es--conditional-var-cvar).

**Conclusion for [Credit Analysts](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis):**
Understanding market risk is crucial for [credit analysts](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#credit-analysis) because:
1.  **Borrower Impact:** Many borrowers are exposed to market risks ([interest rates](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#interest-rate-risk), [FX](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#foreign-exchange-fx-risk--currency-risk), [commodities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#commodities)) that can directly affect their [cash flows](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#cash-flow-from-operations-cfo), [profitability](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#profitability), and ability to [service debt](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#debt-service-coverage-ratio-dscr). Analyzing a borrower's market risk exposures and their [hedging strategies](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#hedging) (if any) is part of comprehensive [credit due diligence](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#due-diligence).
2.  **[Collateral Value](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral):** The value of [collateral](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#collateral) pledged for [loans](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#loan) (e.g., marketable securities, [real estate](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#real-estate), [commodities](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#commodities)) can be subject to market risk.
3.  **Economic Conditions:** Broad market movements often reflect or influence underlying economic conditions, which are a key "C" in the [Five Cs of Credit](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#five-cs-of-credit-character-capacity-capital-collateral-conditions).
4.  **[Financial Institution Analysis](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-institution):** For analysts covering [banks](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#bank) or other [financial institutions](../../Global_Financial_Glossary.md#financial-institutions), understanding their market risk management practices is vital.

This introduction provides a foundation for understanding the various facets of market risk. Subsequent modules will delve deeper into specific measurement and management techniques.
