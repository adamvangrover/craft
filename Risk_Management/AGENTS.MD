# AGENTS.MD - Risk Management Section

## Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review that first.

## 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
The `/Risk_Management/` directory provides a comprehensive understanding of risk management principles, frameworks, and practices, with a particular emphasis on their application in financial services and relevance to credit risk analysis.

The `Risk_Management/README.md` provides an overview of this section and its foundational concepts. It is best viewed via `Risk_Management/index.html`, which uses the site's standard README presentation. This directory also branches into specific risk types.

## 2. Content Structure and Types
The section is organized as follows:
*   **Foundational Concepts (Root of `/Risk_Management/`):**
    *   `01_Introduction_to_Risk_Management.md`
    *   `02_Risk_Identification_and_Assessment_Frameworks.md`
    *   `03_Risk_Reporting_and_Dashboards.md`
    *   `04_Risk_Governance_and_Culture.md`
*   **Specific Risk Subdirectories:** Each major risk type has its own subdirectory (e.g., `Credit_Risk/`, `Market_Risk/`, `Operational_Risk/`, `Liquidity_Risk/` (planned)).
    *   Each subdirectory **MUST** have its own `README.md` explaining its scope and structure.
    *   Within these, content is further broken down by topic (e.g., `Credit_Risk/CRM_01_Fundamentals_of_Credit_Risk.md`).
*   Content should be detailed, well-structured, and include definitions, processes, tools, and examples where applicable.

## 3. Specific Guidelines for Risk Management Content
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Aim for thoroughness in explaining concepts. Risk management is a detailed field.
*   **Frameworks and Processes:** Clearly outline established risk management frameworks (e.g., COSO, Basel Accords concepts where relevant but simplified, 5 Cs of Credit) and processes (e.g., risk management cycle).
*   **Practical Relevance:** Connect theoretical concepts to practical application in financial institutions and for analysts.
*   **Credit Risk Focus:** While covering various risk types, always consider drawing connections back to credit risk analysis where appropriate, as this is a core theme of the overall repository.
*   **Consistency in Naming:** Follow the established naming convention for files (e.g., `CRM_01_...`, `MRM_01_...`).
*   **Placeholder for Future Content:** Use `*(Future Addition)*` or similar markers in READMEs to indicate planned but not-yet-developed content.

## 4. Linking
*   Define and link key risk management terms to the `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Extensively cross-link between different risk topics. For instance, operational risk events can lead to credit or market risk.
*   Link to relevant CRAFT modules in `/corporate-credit-risk-analyst-training/`.
*   Link to `Toolkits_and_Checklists/` if specific tools (e.g., risk assessment checklists) are developed there.
*   Consider if any risk concepts (e.g., VaR calculation, scenario analysis) could be illustrated with an `Interactive_Notebooks/`.

## 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (Illustrative)
*   Detailed content for `Liquidity_Risk/`.
*   Advanced topics in credit risk (e.g., portfolio credit risk models, counterparty credit risk).
*   More detailed examples of risk reports and dashboards.
*   Case studies on risk management failures and successes.
*   Interactive notebooks for quantitative risk measures.
