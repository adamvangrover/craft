    <title>Interactive Encyclopedia of S&P 500 Risk Factors</title>
    
    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Soothing Neutrals" - A palette based on slate and sky colors for a professional, calm, and focused user experience. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-pane interactive reference tool. The left pane is a sticky, filterable navigation tree representing the report's hierarchy. The right pane displays the content. A key interaction is the real-time search bar that filters the navigation tree, allowing users to instantly find specific risks. This structure was chosen because the source material is an encyclopedia; the design prioritizes fast, intuitive information retrieval over a narrative or dashboard format, directly serving the user's need to look up specific terms efficiently. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The primary visualization is a Chart.js Radar chart showing the number of sub-risks within each of the four main categories. Goal: Provide a quick, high-level visual summary of the report's structure and density. Method: Count risks per category from the JS data object and render in a responsive Canvas element. Interaction: Tooltips on hover provide exact counts. The chart is placed at the top as a visual anchor. The main content is presented in structured HTML cards for readability. The search bar is the main interactive tool for content filtering. This approach was chosen to add a visual summary to a text-heavy document without inventing data, fully adhering to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
