# Root CSS Directory

## Overview

This directory contains CSS files that are likely used for styling specific pages at the root level of the repository, such as `home.html` or other primary HTML interface pages.

## Contents

*   **`global_nav.css`**: This stylesheet likely defines the appearance and behavior of the global navigation menu element that is injected into many of the HTML viewer pages across this repository.

## Purpose

Unlike the CSS files within the `/assets/css/` directory (which are for more general site-wide or component-specific styling), the CSS here might be more targeted to foundational HTML pages or specific shared components like the global navigation.

**Note:** If making changes to `global_nav.css`, be aware that it can impact the navigation display on many pages throughout the site.

For agent instructions on handling CSS, refer to `css/AGENTS.MD`.
