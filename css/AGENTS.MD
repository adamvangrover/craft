# Agent Instructions - /css/ Directory

## Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review that first.

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This directory contains CSS files that style specific, often root-level, HTML components, most notably the global navigation menu.

**Distinction from `assets/css/` directory:**
*   Files in `assets/css/` are for general site-wide styling (e.g., Markdown content, quiz appearance).
*   Files in this `css/` directory (i.e., at the repository root) are for specific, often globally injected components like the navigation sidebar.

## 2. General Guidelines for AI Agents

*   **Purpose:** These CSS files control the visual presentation of specific high-level HTML components.
*   **Modification:** Only modify files in this directory if specifically instructed to change styling related to the global navigation or other root-level page elements they control.
*   **Specificity & Impact:** Be mindful that changes to files like `global_nav.css` affect a widely used component. Changes should be tested or carefully considered for their broad impact across all pages that use the global navigation.
*   **Selectors & Style:** Use clear CSS selectors. Maintain consistency with existing styles if making minor changes. If adding new styles, ensure they are well-scoped to avoid unintended side effects.
*   **Pathing:** CSS in this directory is typically referenced from HTML files in the root (e.g., `css/global_nav.css`) or one level down (e.g., `../css/global_nav.css`).

## 3. Key Files

*   **`global_nav.css`**: Styles for the main navigation sidebar generated by `js/global_nav.js` and used on `home.html` and injected into various other hub/viewer pages. Changes here will have a site-wide effect on that navigation component.

## 4. Developer Notes & Future Considerations

*   **Theming:** Currently, theming is not a primary feature. Future enhancements might involve CSS variables for easier theming.
*   **CSS Pre-processors:** The project currently uses plain CSS. If the complexity grows, a pre-processor like SASS/SCSS might be considered in the future.
*   **Style Guide:** For more complex changes, refer to any established style conventions (though not formally documented yet, consistency with existing code is key).
