## Developer Notes

This folder contains content related to the "So What?" element of financial analysis. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for analysts who want to improve their ability to form a compelling narrative, think critically, and deliver persuasive analysis.

When adding new content, please keep the following in mind:

*   **Focus on the "So What?".** The content should always be focused on the practical application of the concepts. It's not enough to just explain what something is. You need to explain why it matters and what analysts should do with that information.
*   **Use clear and concise language.** The content should be easy to understand for analysts of all levels. Avoid jargon and technical terms as much as possible.
*   **Provide concrete examples.** Use case studies and examples to illustrate the concepts. This will make the content more engaging and memorable.
*   **Keep it organized.** The content should be organized in a logical way that makes it easy for users to find what they're looking for.
