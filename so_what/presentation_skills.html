                <li>**White Space:** Is there enough white space on the slide? Or is it cluttered and difficult to read?</li>

            <h3>2. Practicing Your Presentation</h3>
            <p>Practicing your presentation is essential for a smooth and confident delivery. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you prepare:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Rehearse in front of a mirror:</strong> This will help you to become more aware of your body language and facial expressions.</li>
                <li><strong>Record yourself:</strong> This will help you to identify any verbal tics or other bad habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Get feedback from a trusted colleague:</strong> Ask a colleague to watch your presentation and give you honest feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Do a dry run in the presentation room:</strong> This will help you to get comfortable with the space and the equipment.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. Handling Q&A Sessions</h3>
            <p>The Q&A session is an opportunity to engage with your audience and address their concerns. Here are some tips to help you handle it like a pro:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Listen carefully to the question:</strong> Make sure you understand the question before you answer. If you're not sure, ask for clarification.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat the question:</strong> This will ensure that everyone in the audience has heard the question. It will also give you a moment to think about your answer.</li>
                <li><strong>Be concise:</strong> Don't ramble. Get to the point and then move on.</li>
                <li><strong>Be honest:</strong> If you don't know the answer, it's okay to say so. Offer to follow up with the person after the presentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Be respectful:</strong> Even if the question is hostile, always be respectful. Don't get defensive or argumentative.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Framework for Handling Hostile Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge the person's feelings:</strong> "I understand your concern."</li>
                <li><strong>Reframe the question:</strong> "So, what you're asking is..."</li>
                <li><strong>Answer the question:</strong> "The way I see it is..."</li>
                <li><strong>Move on:</strong> "I hope that answers your question. Next question?"</li>
            </ol>
