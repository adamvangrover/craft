            <h2>Moving Beyond the "What" and "Why"</h2>
            <p>The "so what?" is the most important question in financial analysis. It's what separates a good analyst from a great one. A great analyst doesn't just tell you what happened and why. They tell you why it matters and what you should do about it.</p>
            <h3>Case Study: Tesla</h3>
            <p><strong>The What:</strong> Tesla's stock price has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent years.</p>
            <p><strong>The Why:</strong> This is due to a variety of factors, including the company's innovative products, its charismatic CEO, and the growing demand for electric vehicles.</p>
            <p><strong>The So What?:</strong> The volatility of Tesla's stock price presents both opportunities and risks for investors. A risk-averse investor might want to stay away, while a more aggressive investor might see it as a buying opportunity. The "so what" depends on the investor's individual circumstances and risk tolerance.</p>
            <h3>Example: A Company's Declining Margins</h3>
            <p><strong>The What:</strong> A company's profit margins have been declining for the past three quarters.</p>
            <p><strong>The Why:</strong> This is due to rising input costs and increased competition.</p>
            <p><strong>The So What?:</strong> The declining margins are a threat to the company's long-term profitability. Management needs to take action to address this, either by raising prices, cutting costs, or finding new ways to differentiate its products.</p>
