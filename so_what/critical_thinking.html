            <h2>A Framework for Critical Thinking in Financial Analysis</h2>
            <p>Critical thinking is the ability to analyze information objectively and make a reasoned judgment. It's an essential skill for any financial analyst.</p>
            <h3>1. Identify Biases</h3>
            <p>We all have biases that can cloud our judgment. The first step in critical thinking is to be aware of your own biases and take steps to mitigate them.</p>
            <h3>2. Evaluate Assumptions</h3>
            <p>Every analysis is based on a set of assumptions. It's important to evaluate these assumptions and consider how they might affect your conclusions.</p>
            <h3>3. Draw Logical Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Your conclusions should be based on a logical analysis of the evidence. Avoid making leaps of faith or drawing conclusions that are not supported by the data.</p>
