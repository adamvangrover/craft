# REIT Analysis: Beyond Net Income

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate. Analyzing them requires a different set of metrics than traditional corporate equity analysis.

## Why Net Income Lies
In traditional accounting (GAAP), depreciation is deducted from Net Income. However, real estate assets often *appreciate* in value over time. Deducting depreciation artificially lowers Net Income, making the REIT look less profitable than it actually is.

## Key Metrics

### 1. Funds From Operations (FFO)
The industry standard for measuring operating performance.
*   **Formula**:
    Net Income
    (+) Depreciation & Amortization
    (-) Gains on Sales of Property
    (+) Losses on Sales of Property
    = **FFO**

FFO adds back the non-cash depreciation charge and removes one-time gains/losses from property sales to show the recurring cash flow generated by operations.

### 2. Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)
While FFO is better than Net Income, it doesn't account for the capital expenditures (CapEx) required to maintain the properties. AFFO is often considered a proxy for "Free Cash Flow."
*   **Formula**:
    FFO
    (-) Recurring Capital Expenditures (Maintenance CapEx)
    (-) Straight-lining of Rents adjustment
    = **AFFO**

**Valuation Multiple**: Instead of P/E Ratio, REITs are valued using **Price / FFO** or **Price / AFFO**.

### 3. Net Asset Value (NAV)
The estimated market value of a REIT's total assets minus its liabilities.
*   **Formula**:
    (NOI / Market Cap Rate) - Net Debt = **NAV**
*   **Trading Premium/Discount**: If a REIT trades at a price *lower* than its NAV per share, it is trading at a discount (potentially undervalued). If higher, it trades at a premium.

## Key Drivers

*   **Same-Store NOI Growth**: Organic growth from existing properties (raising rents, increasing occupancy).
*   **Cap Rates**: The yield on a property. Lower cap rates mean higher property values.
    *   *Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value*
*   **Interest Rates**: REITs are capital intensive. Rising interest rates increase borrowing costs and often compress valuations.

## Conclusion
To value a REIT, look at its ability to generate cash (AFFO), the underlying value of its assets (NAV), and its growth potential through rent increases and acquisitions.
