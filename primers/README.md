# Industry Primers

## Overview

This directory contains a collection of industry-specific primers. Each primer is designed to provide a foundational understanding of a particular industry, including its key characteristics, business models, drivers, risks, and important considerations for financial and credit analysis.

## Purpose of this Section

The primary goals of this section are to:

*   Offer concise yet comprehensive overviews of various industries.
*   Equip analysts with the specific knowledge needed to assess companies within these sectors.
*   Highlight industry-specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), risks, and valuation nuances.
*   Serve as a quick reference and learning tool for understanding diverse industrial landscapes.

## Navigation and Content Access

*   **Main Interactive Viewer:** The primary way to explore these primers is through the **[Industry Primers Interactive Hub](./index.html)**. This hub provides:
    *   A searchable and filterable list of all available industry primers.
    *   A two-pane view where selecting a primer loads its content (from the Markdown file) directly into the display area.
    *   Links to view the original Markdown (`.md`) source file for each primer.
    *   Links to pre-generated "Enhanced HTML" versions of each primer (located in the `primers/html/` subdirectory).

*   **Individual Primer Files:**
    *   The source content for each primer is written in Markdown (`.md`) and located directly within this `primers/` directory (e.g., `aerospace_defense.md`).
    *   Static HTML versions are also available in the `primers/html/` subdirectory (e.g., `primers/html/aerospace_defense.html`).

## How to Use This Section (Student & Teacher Notes)

**For Students & Analysts:**
*   **Industry Deep Dive:** When analyzing a company, start with the primer for its industry to get crucial context.
*   **Understand Nuances:** Pay attention to how business models, KPIs, and risks differ across sectors.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Use the knowledge from primers to better inform peer comparisons.
*   **Quick Reference:** Return to these primers as a quick refresher when encountering companies in various industries.

**For Teachers & Instructors:**
*   **Foundation for Case Studies:** Use these primers as background reading before assigning industry-specific case studies.
*   **Sector Rotation Discussions:** Primers can inform discussions on how different economic conditions might favor or disadvantage certain sectors.
*   **Guest Speaker Preparation:** Provide relevant primers to students before a guest speaker from a particular industry.

## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **New Primers:** The most significant impact comes from adding primers for industries not yet covered.
*   **Updating Existing Primers:** Industries evolve. Primers should be periodically reviewed and updated for major trend changes, new regulations, or significant shifts in competitive dynamics.
*   **HTML Generation:** The process for generating the static HTML versions in `primers/html/` from the source `.md` files needs to be clear (whether manual or automated). This is detailed in `primers/AGENTS.MD`.
*   **`index.html` Maintenance:** Adding a new primer requires updating the main `primers/index.html` file with a new "primer card" entry, including title, keywords, and correct links.
*   **Keyword Richness:** Ensure the `data-keywords` attribute in each primer card in `index.html` is comprehensive to improve searchability.

## Possible Avenues for Exploration and Further Development

*   **Standardized Financial Ratio Benchmarks:** For key industries, adding typical ranges for common financial ratios.
*   **Visual Aids:** Incorporating simple diagrams (e.g., value chains, competitive landscapes) into the primers.
*   **More Granular Sub-Sector Primers:** For very large or diverse industries (e.g., different types of Technology or Financial Institutions).
*   **Linking to Company Examples:** (With caution and disclaimers) Occasionally referencing publicly available information on major companies to illustrate industry points.

This section is a critical resource for building the broad industry knowledge required for effective financial and credit analysis.
