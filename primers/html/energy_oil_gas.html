                        <p>The oil and gas industry is involved in the exploration, production (upstream), transportation (midstream), and refining and marketing (downstream) of crude oil and natural gas. It's a global, <span class="key-term">capital</span>-intensive, and historically <span class="key-term">cyclical</span> industry with significant <span class="key-term">geopolitical</span> influence.</p>

                                    <li>Often structured as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) in the U.S. for tax efficiency, though some have converted to C-corps.</li>
