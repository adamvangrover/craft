It's a dynamic sector that has undergone significant transformation due to technological advancements, particularly the internet and mobile devices.</p>
                        <p>Key sub-sectors include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Broadcasting:</strong> Traditional television (free-to-air, cable networks) and radio.</li>
                            <li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Newspapers, magazines, books (print and digital).</li>
