                        <p>The automotive industry encompasses the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and selling of motor vehicles. It is one of the world's largest economic sectors by revenue, characterized by high <span class="key-term">capital</span> intensity, significant <span class="key-term">R&D</span> investment, complex global <span class="key-term">supply chains</span>, strong branding, and extensive regulation.</p>
                        <p>Key segments:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Original Equipment Manufacturers (<span class="key-term">OEMs</span>):</strong> Vehicle manufacturers (e.g., Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, Hyundai, Tesla, BMW, Mercedes-Benz).</li>
                            <li><strong>Automotive Suppliers (Parts Manufacturers):</strong> Companies that produce components and systems for <span class="key-term">OEMs</span>. Tier 1 suppliers sell directly to <span class="key-term">OEMs</span>, Tier 2 to Tier 1, and so on. (e.g., Bosch, Denso, Magna, Continental, ZF Friedrichshafen).</li>
                            <li><strong>Automotive Retailers & Distributors:</strong> Dealerships (often franchised) and distributors that sell vehicles to end consumers and provide after-sales services (maintenance, repairs).</li>
                            <li><strong>Automotive Finance (Captive Finance & Others):</strong> Companies providing loans and leases to consumers and businesses for vehicle purchases. Many <span class="key-term">OEMs</span> have "captive" finance arms (e.g., Ford Credit, GM Financial, VW Financial Services).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The industry has a long history of innovation, from the assembly line to advanced safety features, and is currently undergoing a profound transformation.</p>
