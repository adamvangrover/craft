                        <h4>Banks (Depository Institutions)</h4>
                        <p>The core of the financial system, banks take deposits and make loans, profiting from the spread.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Business Model:</strong> Profit from the <span class="key-term">Net Interest Margin (NIM)</span> - the spread between the interest earned on loans and the interest paid on deposits. They also earn fee income from services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Players:</strong> Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) like <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JPMorgan Chase</a> & <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bank of America</a>, and thousands of regional and community banks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Insurance Companies</h4>
                        <p>Insurers manage risk by pooling it among a large number of policyholders.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Business Model:</strong> Collect premiums, invest this "float" to generate investment income, and pay out claims. Profit comes from both underwriting (premiums > claims/expenses) and investment returns.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Asset Managers & Others</h4>

                            <li class="trend-positive"><strong>FinTech Disruption:</strong> Technology is reshaping the industry, from payment apps (Stripe, Block) to online lenders and robo-advisors. Traditional firms are racing to adapt by investing heavily in technology.</li>
                            <li class="trend-neutral"><strong>Interest Rate Environment:</strong> The move away from a zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) has been a major tailwind for bank profitability (higher NIMs), but a headwind for insurers' existing fixed-income investment portfolios (unrealized losses).</li>

                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Credit Risk:</strong> The risk that borrowers will default on their loans. This is the biggest risk for banks and is highly correlated with the economic cycle, particularly unemployment.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> The risk of not being able to meet short-term obligations. This is what causes bank runs (e.g., the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023) when depositors withdraw funds en masse.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Systemic Risk:</strong> The risk that the failure of one large, interconnected institution could trigger a cascading failure throughout the entire financial system. This is why the sector is so heavily regulated.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Underwriting Risk (Insurers):</strong> The risk that premiums collected are insufficient to cover future claims, due to mispricing policies or higher-than-expected losses (e.g., a major hurricane).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Regulation is Everything:</strong> You cannot analyze a financial institution without understanding its regulatory environment. Capital and liquidity rules are the binding constraints on growth and shareholder returns. Follow releases from the <a href="https://www.bis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIS</a> and national regulators.</li>
                            <li><strong>For Banks, Watch Asset Quality Like a Hawk:</strong> Track trends in non-performing loans (NPLs), loan loss provisions, and net charge-offs. Are they rising? Are they concentrated in a specific sector like Commercial Real Estate?</li>
                            <li><strong>For P&C Insurers, It's All About the Combined Ratio:</strong> A company that consistently posts a combined ratio below 100% demonstrates a strong underwriting culture and is less reliant on volatile investment income.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assess the Funding Mix:</strong> For banks, a high percentage of stable, low-cost, insured retail deposits is a major credit positive compared to a reliance on more fickle and expensive wholesale funding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Read the Footnotes:</strong> Financial institution accounting is notoriously complex. Pay close attention to disclosures on derivatives, loan portfolio composition, and the valuation of Level 3 assets.</li>
