                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Oversupply Risk:</strong> A boom in development, fueled by cheap capital, can lead to an oversupply of properties in a specific market, causing rents and occupancy to fall.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Lease Rollover Risk:</strong> A large concentration of leases expiring in a single year creates risk that tenants will not renew, or will only renew at lower rents, causing a sudden drop in cash flow.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Tenant Default Risk:</strong> The risk that tenants will go bankrupt and be unable to pay rent, a major concern during economic downturns, particularly in the retail sector.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Location, Location, Location:</strong> It's a clich√© for a reason. A well-located portfolio in markets with strong demographic and economic growth (e.g., the Sun Belt in the US) provides a significant buffer against downturns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analyze the Lease Expiration Schedule:</strong> Look for a well-staggered schedule with no major concentration in any single year. Check the Weighted Average Lease Term (WALT) - longer is generally better and provides more cash flow visibility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check Tenant Quality and Diversification:</strong> Is the portfolio reliant on a single tenant or industry? Are the tenants investment-grade companies? Check the top 10 tenant concentration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on AFFO for Dividend Coverage:</strong> Don't be fooled by FFO. A REIT's ability to sustainably pay its dividend should be measured against AFFO, which accounts for the capital required to maintain the properties.</li>
                            <li><strong>Understand the Secular Story:</strong> Is the property type benefiting from long-term trends (like Industrial and Data Centers) or fighting against them (like Office and Malls)? The secular story often matters more than the cyclical one.</li>
