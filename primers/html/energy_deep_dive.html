                    <div class="primer-section-content">
                        <h4>Upstream (Highest Risk)</h4>
                        <p>Credit risk is highest in the upstream segment. The business is a pure play on commodity prices. A company can be highly profitable one year and facing bankruptcy the next. Key credit questions revolve around:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cost Position:</strong> Can the company still generate free cash flow if oil prices fall to $50? $40? A low breakeven cost is the best defense.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hedging:</strong> How much of the next 12-24 months of production is hedged, providing a floor on cash flow? A strong hedging program is a major credit positive.</li>
                            <li><strong>Asset Quality:</strong> What is the size and productive life of its reserves? Is it concentrated in a single basin?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Midstream (Lowest Risk)</h4>
                        <p>This is generally the lowest-risk segment, often viewed as a "utility-like" business. The "toll road" model provides stable, predictable cash flows. Key credit questions are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Contract Quality:</strong> Are contracts long-term and fee-based? Do they have Minimum Volume Commitments (MVCs)?</li>
                            <li><strong>Counterparty Risk:</strong> Who are the upstream producers shipping on the pipeline? Are they financially healthy? A pipeline is only as strong as the drillers who supply it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Asset Diversification:</strong> Is the company reliant on a single pipeline or a single oil-producing region (e.g., the Bakken vs. the Permian)?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Downstream (Moderate to High Risk)</h4>
                        <p>Risk is moderate to high. While not directly exposed to the absolute price of crude, refiners are exposed to the <span class="key-term">"crack spread,"</span> which can be very volatile. Refining is a high-fixed-cost, high-volume business. Key credit questions include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Refinery Complexity & Location:</strong> Can the refinery process cheaper, lower-quality crude oils to boost its margins? Does it have cost-advantaged access to crude supplies and a ready market for its products?</li>
                            <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> What is the refinery's utilization rate and track record on safety and maintenance? Unplanned outages are very costly.</li>
                        </ul>
