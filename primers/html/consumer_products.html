                        <p>The consumer products sector encompasses companies that manufacture and/or sell goods directly to consumers. It's a vast and diverse industry, broadly categorized into:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Consumer Staples (Non-Durables / Non-<span class="key-term">Cyclicals</span>):</strong> Essential goods that people buy regularly, regardless of their financial situation. Demand tends to be stable.
                                <ul><li>Examples: Food and beverages, household cleaning products, personal care items (toiletries, cosmetics), tobacco, alcohol.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Consumer Discretionary (Durables / <span class="key-term">Cyclicals</span>):</strong> Non-essential goods and services that consumers buy when they have sufficient disposable income. Demand is more sensitive to economic cycles.
                                <ul><li>Examples: Automobiles, apparel and footwear, luxury goods, consumer electronics, home furnishings, appliances, leisure products, restaurants, hotels.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many companies operate in both categories or have product lines that blur the distinction (e.g., a premium coffee brand could have elements of both staple and discretionary). Branding, marketing, distribution, and <span class="key-term">supply chain</span> management are critical success factors across the sector.</p>
