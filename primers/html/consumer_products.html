                    <div class="primer-section-content">
                        <h4>Consumer Staples</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Input Cost Inflation:</strong> Highly exposed to volatility in agricultural commodities, energy, and packaging costs. The inability to pass these costs to consumers via price increases will crush margins.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Retailer Concentration:</strong> Heavy reliance on a few large retailers like <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.costco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Costco</a> gives those customers immense bargaining power on pricing and promotions.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Brand Obsolescence:</strong> Failure to innovate and adapt to changing consumer tastes (e.g., the shift away from sugary drinks or towards sustainable packaging) can lead to long-term decline.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Consumer Discretionary</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Economic Cyclicality:</strong> Demand is highly vulnerable to recessions, unemployment, and declines in consumer confidence. These are often the first purchases to be cut from household budgets.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Fashion & Trend Risk:</strong> A major risk in apparel and electronics. What is popular today can be obsolete tomorrow. Requires constant innovation and marketing spend.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Misjudging demand can lead to costly inventory write-downs and margin-crushing promotions to clear out unwanted goods.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="primer-section-content">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Decompose Organic Growth:</strong> Is the company just raising prices, or is it actually selling more units (volume)? Volume growth is a much healthier sign of brand strength.</li>
                            <li><strong>Watch the Gross Margin:</strong> In an inflationary environment, the gross margin is the best real-time indicator of a company's pricing power. A stable or expanding gross margin is a strong positive signal.</li>
                            <li><strong>For Discretionary, Track Inventory Days:</strong> An inventory growth rate that consistently outpaces sales growth is a major red flag, often signaling future discounting and margin pressure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assess Brand Strength:</strong> Does the company have a few dominant "power brands," or a diversified portfolio? Is it positioned in growing or declining categories? Check sources like <a href="https://www.brandirectory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand Finance</a> for rankings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check the Financial Policy:</strong> Consumer Staples companies often generate significant, stable cash flow. How are they using it? Aggressive, debt-funded M&A or share buybacks can quickly change the credit profile.</li>
