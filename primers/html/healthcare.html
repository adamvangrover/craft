A surprise rejection (a "Complete Response Letter") can be catastrophic for a biotech company.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Reimbursement Risk:</strong> A government decision (e.g., from CMS in the US) to cut reimbursement rates for a specific procedure or drug can instantly impact profitability for providers and manufacturers.</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>Litigation Risk:</strong> Product liability lawsuits are a constant threat for pharma and medtech companies, with potential for multi-billion dollar settlements (e.g., historical cases involving opioids, talc, or specific medical devices).</li>
                            <li class="trend-negative"><strong>R&D Failure:</strong> The vast majority of drugs that enter clinical trials never make it to market. This high failure rate is a core business risk that requires significant capital.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>For Pharma, Analyze the Pipeline:</strong> Don't just look at current sales. What's in Phase III trials? When do key patents expire? This determines future cash flows. Resources like <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> can be useful.</li>
                            <li><strong>For Providers, Understand the Payer Mix:</strong> A hospital system with high exposure to low-margin Medicaid is a different credit risk than one with a high-paying commercial insurance base.</li>
                            <li><strong>For Insurers, Watch the MLR:</strong> Is the Medical Loss Ratio stable or rising? A sudden jump can signal poor pricing or higher-than-expected healthcare utilization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Follow the FDA:</strong> Keep track of FDA advisory committee meetings (AdComms) and PDUFA dates (Prescription Drug User Fee Act dates) for key products in a company's portfolio.</li>
                            <li><strong>Read the Clinical Data:</strong> For biotech, don't just take the company's press release at face value. Look at the published clinical trial data in medical journals. Is the drug truly effective and safe compared to the standard of care?</li>
