                        <p>The telecommunications (<span class="key-term">telecom</span>) industry provides the infrastructure and services that enable voice, data, and video transmission. Historically dominated by state-owned monopolies providing fixed-line voice services, the sector has undergone massive transformation due to deregulation, privatization, and technological innovation.</p>
                        <p>Key sub-sectors include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Wireless (Mobile):</strong> Voice and data services for mobile phones and other wireless devices. This is the largest and often most profitable segment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wireline (Fixed-Line):</strong> Traditional voice services, broadband internet (DSL, fiber), and business data services (e.g., dedicated lines, MPLS).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cable Operators:</strong> While also media providers, their infrastructure (coaxial, fiber) is critical for broadband internet and sometimes phone services. Often compete directly with traditional telcos.</li>
                            <li><strong>Satellite Services:</strong> Broadband, <span class="key-term">TV</span>, and specialized communication services, particularly in remote areas.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Centers & Towers:</strong> Infrastructure providers leasing space and power to <span class="key-term">telecom</span> operators and other tech companies. Tower companies own and lease space on cell towers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Innovation has driven shifts from analog to digital, fixed to mobile, voice-centric to data-centric, and now towards <span class="key-term">5G</span>, <span class="key-term">IoT</span>, and fiber densification.</p>
