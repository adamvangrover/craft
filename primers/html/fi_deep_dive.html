                        <h4>The Bank's Balance Sheet Challenge: Asset-Liability Mismatch</h4>
                        <p>A bank's core challenge is managing a fundamental <span class="key-term">asset-liability mismatch</span>. It "borrows short" (deposits that can be withdrawn at any time) to "lend long" (multi-year, illiquid loans). This creates two major, interconnected risks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interest Rate Risk:</strong> If interest rates rise sharply, the bank's cost of deposits can increase faster than the yield on its fixed-rate loan portfolio, crushing its Net Interest Margin (NIM). This also creates unrealized losses on any securities it holds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> If depositors lose confidence (perhaps due to concerns about those unrealized losses) and withdraw their money en masse (a "bank run"), the bank cannot easily sell its illiquid loans to meet redemptions. This is exactly what caused the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therefore, a bank's credit analysis hinges on the quality of its loan book (asset quality) and the stability of its funding base (a high percentage of insured, retail deposits is best).</p>

                        <h4>The Insurer's Advantage: Float</h4>
                        <p>An insurer's model is the inverse. It receives cash upfront in the form of premiums and holds this cash (called <span class="key-term">"float"</span>) before paying it out for future claims. It invests this float, primarily in a diversified portfolio of high-quality bonds, to earn income.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Underwriting Profit/Loss:</strong> The goal is to price policies correctly so that premiums collected exceed claims and expenses paid. A <span class="key-term">Combined Ratio</span> below 100% signifies an underwriting profit. Consistently achieving this is the hallmark of a high-quality insurer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Investment Income:</strong> The income earned on the float is a second, and often larger, source of profit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An insurer's credit analysis, therefore, focuses on its underwriting discipline (is the combined ratio consistently low and stable?) and the quality and performance of its investment portfolio.</p>
