                            <li>Differentiate Between Commercial Aero and Defense Segments: Understand their distinct drivers and <span class="key-term">risk</span> profiles.</li>
                            <li><strong>For Commercial Aero:</strong><ul><li>Track Air Traffic Data (Global & Regional): IATA statistics, airline load factors.</li><li>Monitor Aircraft Orders, Deliveries, and Backlogs: Boeing and Airbus monthly reports.</li><li>Assess Airline Profitability & Fleet Plans:</li><li>Follow New Aircraft Program Developments & Certification Progress:</li><li>Scrutinize <span class="key-term">Supply Chain</span> Health & Production Rates:</li></ul></li>
                            <li><strong>For Defense:</strong><ul><li>Monitor Government Defense Budgets & Spending Authorizations: (e.g., U.S. National Defense Authorization Act - NDAA).</li><li>Track Major Contract Awards & Program Milestones:</li><li>Assess Company Backlogs (Funded vs. Unfunded) & Book-to-Bill Ratios:</li><li>Understand <span class="key-term">Geopolitical</span> Trends & National Security Priorities:</li></ul></li>
                            <li>Evaluate Program <span class="key-term">Diversification</span>: Reduces reliance on a single large program.</li>
                            <li>Assess Management Track Record in Program Execution:</li>
                            <li>Analyze <span class="key-term">Liquidity</span> & <span class="key-term">FCF</span> Generation: Especially for commercial aero companies with high <span class="key-term">capex</span>/<span class="key-term">R&D</span>.</li>
                            <li>Consider the Mix of OE vs. Aftermarket Revenue (Commercial Aero): Higher aftermarket contribution generally means more stability.</li>
                            <li>Understand Contract Types (Defense): Cost-plus contracts are lower <span class="key-term">risk</span> than fixed-price contracts for contractors.</li>
                            <li>Stay Abreast of Technological Advancements & <span class="key-term">R&D</span> Focus in Both Segments: (e.g., SAFs, hypersonics, <span class="key-term">AI</span>).</li>
