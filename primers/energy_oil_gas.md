# Energy (Oil & Gas) Industry Primer

## 1. Industry Overview

**History and Background:**
The oil and gas industry is involved in the exploration, production (upstream), transportation (midstream), and refining and marketing (downstream) of crude oil and natural gas. It's a global, capital-intensive, and historically cyclical industry with significant geopolitical influence.

Key sub-sectors:
*   **Upstream (Exploration & Production - E&P):** Finding and extracting crude oil and natural gas.
    *   **Integrated Majors:** Large companies involved in all stages (e.g., ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, TotalEnergies). Often have significant downstream and chemical operations.
    *   **Independent E&Ps:** Focus primarily on exploration and production. Vary greatly in size and geographic focus.
    *   **National Oil Companies (NOCs):** State-owned entities that control vast reserves (e.g., Saudi Aramco, PetroChina, Gazprom).
*   **Midstream:** Transporting, storing, and processing oil and gas.
    *   Pipelines (oil, natural gas, NGLs - Natural Gas Liquids).
    *   Gathering and processing facilities.
    *   Storage facilities (tanks, underground caverns).
    *   Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals (liquefaction and regasification).
    *   Often structured as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) in the U.S. for tax efficiency, though some have converted to C-corps.
*   **Downstream (Refining & Marketing - R&M):** Refining crude oil into petroleum products and marketing these products.
    *   Refineries.
    *   Gasoline service stations, fuel distribution networks.
    *   Petrochemicals (often integrated with refining).
*   **Oilfield Services & Equipment:** Provide drilling services, equipment, and technical expertise to E&P companies.
    *   Drilling contractors (onshore, offshore rigs).
    *   Pressure pumping, well completion services.
    *   Seismic and reservoir analysis.
    *   Equipment manufacturing.

Commodity prices (crude oil - WTI, Brent; natural gas - Henry Hub, TTF) are the primary driver of industry profitability, particularly for the upstream segment.

**Long-Term Trends:**
*   **Energy Transition & Decarbonization:** Global shift towards lower-carbon energy sources (renewables, hydrogen) driven by climate change concerns and policy initiatives (e.g., Paris Agreement). This poses an existential challenge/opportunity for the industry.
*   **Peak Oil Demand (Uncertainty):** Debate over when global oil demand will peak, with varying forecasts. Natural gas is often seen as a "bridge fuel."
*   **Shale Revolution (U.S.):** Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unlocked vast U.S. shale oil and gas resources, transforming global energy markets. Focus now shifting from "growth at any cost" to "value/returns."
*   **Geopolitics & Supply Security:** Oil and gas supply remains heavily influenced by OPEC+ decisions, political stability in producing regions, and global conflicts. Energy security is a rising concern.
*   **Technological Advancements:** Improved drilling techniques, digitalization (AI, big data for reservoir management), carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
*   **ESG Pressures:** Increasing scrutiny from investors, lenders, and society regarding environmental impact (emissions, spills), social responsibility, and governance.
*   **Capital Discipline & Shareholder Returns:** Post-shale boom/bust cycles, E&Ps are focusing more on free cash flow generation, debt reduction, and returning capital to shareholders (dividends, buybacks) rather than aggressive production growth.
*   **LNG Market Growth:** Growing global demand for LNG as a cleaner alternative to coal and for supply diversification.

## 2. Business Cycles

*   **Highly Cyclical (especially Upstream & Oilfield Services):** Profitability is directly tied to volatile commodity prices, which are influenced by global supply/demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and economic growth.
    *   **Upstream:** High prices incentivize drilling and investment; low prices lead to capex cuts, project deferrals, and bankruptcies.
    *   **Oilfield Services:** Demand for services and equipment follows upstream spending cycles. Often experiences deeper and sharper cycles.
    *   **Midstream:** More stable due to long-term, fee-based contracts or regulated returns for many pipelines. However, can have volume risk if upstream production declines significantly, or counterparty risk.
    *   **Downstream:** Profitability (crack spreads - difference between crude oil cost and refined product prices) is influenced by regional supply/demand for refined products, refinery utilization, and crude oil input costs. Can sometimes be counter-cyclical to upstream (e.g., lower crude prices can boost refining margins if product prices don't fall as quickly).

Geopolitical events can cause sharp, unpredictable swings in prices.

## 3. Key Credit Metrics

**Upstream (E&P):**
*   **Realized Prices:** Average prices received for oil and gas, including impact of hedging.
*   **Production Volumes:** (Barrels of oil equivalent per day - boe/d).
*   **Lifting Costs / Production Costs:** Cost per barrel to extract oil/gas.
*   **Finding & Development (F&D) Costs:** Cost to add new reserves.
*   **Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR):** New reserves added / production. Ideally >100%.
*   **Proved Reserves (1P, 2P):** Estimated quantities of oil/gas recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions. Reserve life (Reserves/Production).
*   **EBITDAX Margin:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Exploration Expense. Common E&P profitability measure.
*   **Netbacks:** Revenue per barrel less royalties, production taxes, and operating expenses.
*   **Recycle Ratio:** Netback / F&D costs. Measures profitability of reinvestment.
*   **Hedging Program:** Percentage of production hedged and at what prices. Provides cash flow visibility.
*   **Leverage:** Debt/EBITDAX, Debt/Proved Reserves, Debt/Flowing Barrel.

**Midstream:**
*   **Throughput Volumes:** Volumes transported or processed.
*   **Fee-Based Revenue %:** Higher percentage indicates more stable cash flows.

    *   **Cost Position:** All-in costs (lifting + F&D) relative to peers and price deck.
    *   **Reserve Life & Development Risk:**
    *   **Hedging Strategy:**
    *   **Operating Track Record:**
*   **Financial Risk Profile:**
    *   **Leverage:** Debt/EBITDAX, Debt/Production. Agencies have specific leverage thresholds for different rating categories based on their price deck assumptions.
    *   **Profitability & Cash Flow:** Expected cash flow generation at various price scenarios.
    *   **Liquidity:** Access to credit facilities, cash on hand. Critical in volatile markets.
    *   **Financial Policy:** Commitment to leverage targets, approach to capex and shareholder returns through price cycles.

**Midstream:** Emphasis on contract quality, volume risk, counterparty risk, and cash flow stability.
**Downstream:** Focus on refining complexity, scale, feedstock flexibility, and market access.
**Oilfield Services:** Cyclicality, competitive landscape, technology, and balance sheet strength.

Rating agencies publish their commodity price deck assumptions, which are crucial for assessing credit quality.
