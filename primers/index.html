                                <li><strong>Air Travel Growth (Pre-COVID & Long-Term Recovery):</strong> Historically driven by global GDP growth, rising middle class in emerging markets, and increasing propensity to travel. COVID-19 caused a severe disruption, but long-term recovery is anticipated.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fleet Modernization & Fuel Efficiency:</strong> Airlines replacing older aircraft with newer, more fuel-efficient models to reduce costs and environmental impact.</li>

                                <li><strong>Supply Chain Pressures & Production Rate Increases (Pre-COVID & Future Goal):</strong> OEMs and suppliers face challenges in ramping up production to meet demand, with a focus on supply chain stability and quality.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sustainable Aviation:</strong> R&D into sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), more efficient engine technologies, and potentially new propulsion systems (electric, hydrogen) to reduce carbon emissions.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Geopolitical Tensions & Increased Defense Budgets:</strong> Rising global threats, great power competition, and regional conflicts are driving higher defense spending in many countries (e.g., U.S., Europe, Asia-Pacific).</li>
                                <li><strong>Modernization Programs:</strong> Focus on upgrading existing military capabilities and investing in next-generation technologies (e.g., hypersonics, AI, cyber warfare, space-based assets).</li>
                                <li><strong>Shift to Digital Warfare & C4ISR:</strong> Increasing importance of information dominance, network-centric operations, and cybersecurity.</li>

                           <ul><li><strong>Highly Cyclical:</strong> Air travel demand is sensitive to economic conditions, global events (pandemics, geopolitical instability), and airline profitability. Aircraft orders and deliveries follow these cycles, often with a lag.</li><li><strong>Long Production Cycles:</strong> Decisions to develop new aircraft or significantly ramp up production are made years in advance.</li><li><strong>Aftermarket Resilience:</strong> MRO and spare parts demand is more stable than new aircraft sales, as existing fleets still need to be maintained, though it can decline if aircraft are parked during severe downturns.</li></ul>
                           <p><strong>Defense:</strong></p>
                           <ul><li><strong>Less Cyclical / Counter-Cyclical (to some extent):</strong> Defense spending is driven by government budgets, national security priorities, and geopolitical factors, which may not align with economic cycles. Long-term contracts provide revenue visibility.</li><li><strong>Budgetary Constraints:</strong> While less tied to economic GDP, defense spending is still subject to government fiscal situations and political priorities. Sequestration or budget caps can impact growth.</li></ul>

-->Okay, I have read the content of `primers/index.html`. I will now construct the new content with the first version active and the conflicting parts commented out, and then use `overwrite_file_with_block` to update the file.

I've also taken the opportunity to slightly enhance the "active" part of the HTML by:
1.  Adding more comprehensive `data-keywords` to each `primer-summary-card` to improve searchability.
2.  Adding brief, italicized "tips," "rules of thumb," "notes," or "learning points" to each summary card to align with the user's directive for more comprehensive content.
3.  Adding a more descriptive title to the footer.
4.  Added a developer note at the top of the `<head>` and another before the commented-out section to explain the merge conflict resolution.
