The Corporate Credit Risk Analyst Training (CRAFT) Program Curriculum


Module 1: The Foundations of Credit Analysis

This foundational module establishes the essential context and core principles of corporate credit analysis. It is designed to instill a risk-management mindset from the outset, providing the conceptual scaffolding upon which all subsequent technical skills will be built. Participants will learn the fundamental purpose of their role, the structured frameworks used to assess creditworthiness, and the economic and accounting principles that underpin all credit decisions.

1.1 The Role of a Credit Analyst & The Credit Lifecycle

This sub-module introduces the "why" behind credit analysis, positioning the analyst not merely as a processor of loan applications but as a crucial guardian of the financial institution's capital. It grounds the analyst in the foundational frameworks and processes that govern the world of credit.

Learning Objectives

Articulate the primary purpose of credit analysis as a function of capital preservation and risk management for a financial institution.
Master the Five C's of Credit framework and explain how each component contributes to a holistic view of borrower risk.
Describe the distinct stages of the credit lifecycle and identify the key tasks an analyst performs at each stage.
Explain the interconnectedness of the Five C's, demonstrating how a change in one factor can impact the others.

Key Concepts Outline

The "Why" of Credit Analysis: A Risk Management Imperative
The primary function of a credit analyst is to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers to minimize the risk of default and protect the lender's capital.1
This role is central to the safety and soundness of any lending institution, as capital depletion through loan losses has been the proximate cause of most bank failures.2
The objective is not simply to approve or decline loans but to make informed, risk-adjusted decisions that align with the institution's risk appetite.3 This involves identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling risk levels within the lending portfolio.5
The Five C's of Credit: A Foundational Framework
The Five C's provide a structured, comprehensive method for assessing a potential borrower's creditworthiness, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative measures.6
Character: This refers to the borrower's reputation, integrity, and track record of meeting obligations. It is arguably the most important "C" and seeks to answer the question: "Is the borrower trustworthy and willing to repay?".8 Assessment involves reviewing credit history, management's experience and reputation, and relationships with suppliers and customers.9
Capacity: This assesses the borrower's ability to repay the debt from its operating cash flow. It is the quantitative core of the analysis, focusing on historical and projected financial performance to determine if sufficient cash is generated to cover debt service obligations.6 Key metrics like the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) are introduced here.11
Capital: This evaluates the borrower's financial strength and the amount of their own money invested in the business, often referred to as "skin in the game".11 A strong capital base (net worth) provides a cushion to absorb losses and withstand economic downturns, demonstrating the owner's commitment.8
Collateral: These are the assets pledged by the borrower to secure the loan, representing the lender's secondary source of repayment or "Plan B" in the event of a default.11 The analysis involves valuing the collateral and understanding the lender's legal claim to it.12
Conditions: This encompasses the external macroeconomic and industry-specific factors that could affect the borrower's ability to repay. This includes the stability of the industry, competitive pressures, and the overall economic cycle (e.g., recession, expansion).8
The Credit Lifecycle: A Process-Oriented View
The role of a credit analyst spans the entire lifecycle of a loan, from inception to final repayment or resolution.14
Origination & Application: The process begins when a potential borrower applies for credit. The initial stage involves gathering basic information and necessary financial documents.15
Underwriting & Analysis: This is the core of the analyst's work. It involves a deep dive into the borrower's financials, assessing the Five C's, identifying risks, and structuring the loan appropriately.13
Documentation & Closing: Once a loan is approved, the legal terms are finalized in a credit agreement. The analyst ensures the documentation accurately reflects the approved terms and conditions.17
Monitoring & Annual Review: After the loan is funded, the analyst's role shifts to ongoing monitoring. This includes tracking financial performance, ensuring compliance with covenants, and conducting periodic (typically annual) reviews to reassess the borrower's risk profile.5
Workout & Recovery: If a borrower's financial condition deteriorates and they are unable to meet their obligations, the loan enters the workout stage. The analyst's role is to support the process of restructuring the loan or managing the recovery process to minimize the lender's loss.16

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide a one-page summary of a fictional small business, "Artisan Roasters Inc.," seeking a term loan to purchase a new coffee roaster. The summary includes a brief company history, owner's background, a simplified balance sheet, and a statement of purpose for the loan. Trainees are tasked with reading the summary and writing a short analysis identifying and discussing each of the Five C's of Credit based on the information provided, highlighting areas where more information would be needed.

Assessment Method

A multiple-choice quiz covering the definitions of the Five C's, the stages of the credit lifecycle, and the primary objective of credit analysis. The quiz will include scenario-based questions asking the trainee to identify which "C" of credit is most relevant to a given piece of information.

1.2 Mastering Financial Accounting

This sub-module provides a creditor-focused deep dive into financial accounting. It moves beyond the mechanics of debits and credits to teach analysts how to interpret financial statements as a narrative of a company's operational performance and financial health. Special emphasis is placed on areas requiring significant management judgment and the critical skill of dissecting the notes to the financial statements.

Learning Objectives

Explain the mechanical linkages between the three core financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement).
Analyze a company's revenue recognition policies under ASC 606/IFRS 15 and identify potential areas of aggressive accounting or earnings management.
Distinguish between recurring operating expenses and non-recurring items to calculate a "normalized" view of a company's core profitability.
Deconstruct and analyze the key components of working capital and their impact on a company's operating cash flow.
Demonstrate the ability to locate and interpret critical risk factors within the Notes to the Financial Statements, such as debt covenants, contingent liabilities, and related-party transactions.

Key Concepts Outline

The Three Financial Statements and Their Interlinkages
Income Statement: Reports a company's financial performance over a period, detailing revenues and expenses to arrive at net income.18
Balance Sheet: Provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a single point in time, detailing assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity, adhering to the fundamental equation: Assets=Liabilities+Equity.20
Cash Flow Statement: Reconciles the net income from the income statement to the change in the cash balance on the balance sheet, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities.18
The Core Linkage: Net income from the income statement flows into retained earnings within shareholders' equity on the balance sheet. The cash flow statement explains the change in the cash account on the balance sheet from one period to the next.
Revenue Recognition (ASC 606 / IFRS 15): A Creditor's Perspective
The core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the expected consideration.22 This standard is crucial for ensuring comparability and reliability of revenue figures.24
The Five-Step Model: A systematic framework for revenue recognition 24:
Identify the contract with a customer.
Identify the separate performance obligations in the contract.
Determine the transaction price.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.
Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
Areas of Judgment for Analysts: The standard requires significant management judgment, creating potential for earnings manipulation. Analysts must critically assess disclosures related to 25:
Variable Consideration: How does the company estimate rebates, discounts, or performance bonuses?
Performance Obligations: How does the company define a "distinct" good or service, especially in bundled contracts (e.g., software and support)?
Timing of Recognition: Does the company recognize revenue "at a point in time" or "over time"? The choice of method can significantly impact reported results.22
Analyzing Expenses and Profitability
Expense Recognition: Matching expenses to the revenues they help generate.
Operating vs. Non-Recurring Items: A key analytical task is to separate one-time events (e.g., gains/losses on asset sales, restructuring charges, litigation settlements) from the core, ongoing expenses of the business.27 This allows the calculation of "normalized" earnings, which is a better predictor of future performance.
Working Capital and Operating Liquidity
Components: A detailed look at Accounts Receivable (AR), Inventory, and Accounts Payable (AP).
Cash Conversion Cycle: The time it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash. Formula: Days Inventory Outstanding+Days Sales Outstanding−Days Payable Outstanding. A lengthening cycle can signal liquidity problems.29
The Notes to the Financial Statements: The Analyst's Forensic Toolkit
The footnotes are not supplementary; they are an integral part of the financial statements, providing critical context and detail that is essential for a thorough credit analysis.30
Key Disclosures to Scrutinize:
Significant Accounting Policies: Reveals the specific methods and assumptions used by management (e.g., inventory valuation, depreciation methods). Comparing these to industry norms can reveal conservative or aggressive accounting stances.30
Debt: Provides a detailed schedule of all outstanding debt, including interest rates, maturity dates, and, crucially, financial covenants. This is a primary area of focus for credit analysts.33
Commitments and Contingencies: Discloses potential future liabilities that are not yet recorded on the balance sheet, such as legal proceedings, loan guarantees, or non-cancelable operating leases. This is a key source of "hidden" risk.33
Related-Party Transactions: Details any transactions between the company and its owners, management, or other affiliated entities. These require scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest or non-market terms.34
Segment Information: Breaks down the company's revenue and profit by business line or geographic region, allowing for a more granular analysis of performance drivers.33

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with the full 10-K report for a publicly traded manufacturing company. The exercise is a "scavenger hunt" within the Notes to the Financial Statements. Trainees must locate and summarize specific pieces of information, such as:
The company's revenue recognition policy for its primary product line.
A schedule of its long-term debt maturities for the next five years.
The total amount of non-cancelable operating lease commitments.
The details of any significant pending litigation.
The revenue and operating income for its largest geographic segment.

Assessment Method

A written assignment requiring trainees to analyze a short case study involving a company that has adopted a new, aggressive revenue recognition policy. Trainees must explain the policy based on the provided footnote, calculate the impact on reported revenue, and articulate why this change represents a significant credit risk.

1.3 Financial Statement Analysis (FSA) for Creditors

This sub-module hones the analyst's skills in quantitative analysis, specifically through the lens of a creditor. It emphasizes that for a lender, the ultimate purpose of ratio analysis is not just to describe a company's performance but to assess its capacity for debt repayment and its resilience to financial stress.

Learning Objectives

Differentiate between the objectives of credit analysis (downside risk mitigation) and equity analysis (upside potential).
Calculate and interpret the four key categories of financial ratios: Liquidity, Solvency/Leverage, Coverage, and Profitability.
Apply trend analysis and common-size statement analysis to identify patterns and structural changes in a company's financial performance.
Synthesize ratio analysis, trend analysis, and peer comparisons to form a coherent credit narrative and identify key financial red flags.

Key Concepts Outline

Adopting the Creditor's Lens
Unlike equity investors who focus on growth and future stock appreciation, credit analysts are primarily concerned with downside risk, capital preservation, and the certainty of repayment.4
The central questions are: 1) Can the borrower service its debt obligations from cash flow? 2) In a worst-case scenario, is there sufficient collateral value to recover the principal?
A Structured Framework for Ratio Analysis
Ratio analysis is the process of using financial statement data to calculate statistical relationships that provide insights into a company's performance and financial health.18 A single ratio is a snapshot, but its true power comes from comparison over time and against peers.39
Liquidity Ratios: Measure the ability to meet short-term obligations (due within one year). A primary concern for lenders, as a liquidity crisis can lead to default even in a profitable company.38
Current Ratio: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio (Acid-Test): (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
Solvency/Leverage Ratios: Measure the extent to which a company relies on debt to finance its assets and its ability to meet long-term obligations. High leverage amplifies risk.38
Debt-to-Assets Ratio: Total Debt / Total Assets
Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio: Total Debt / EBITDA (A key covenant metric)
Coverage Ratios: Directly assess the ability of a company's earnings or cash flow to cover its interest and principal payments. These are among the most critical ratios for credit analysis.38
Interest Coverage Ratio: EBIT / Interest Expense
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR): A measure of cash flow available to pay current debt obligations. A common formulation is (EBITDA - Maintenance CapEx) / (Total Debt Service).
Profitability Ratios: Measure the company's ability to generate profits from its sales and assets. Profit is the ultimate source of cash flow and repayment capacity.38
Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit / Revenue
EBITDA Margin: EBITDA / Revenue
Net Profit Margin: Net Income / Revenue
Return on Assets (ROA): Net Income / Total Assets
Return on Equity (ROE): Net Income / Total Equity
DuPont Analysis: Deconstructing ROE
DuPont analysis breaks down ROE into three components to provide deeper insight into performance drivers: ROE=(Net Profit Margin)×(Asset Turnover)×(Equity Multiplier).39
This framework allows an analyst to determine if high ROE is driven by strong profitability, efficient asset use, or high financial leverage—the latter being a potential source of risk.
Dynamic Analysis Techniques
Trend Analysis (Horizontal Analysis): Evaluating ratio performance over several periods (e.g., 3-5 years) to identify the direction and magnitude of change. An improving trend provides comfort, while a deteriorating trend is a significant warning sign.18
Common-Size Analysis (Vertical Analysis): Expressing all income statement items as a percentage of revenue and all balance sheet items as a percentage of total assets. This facilitates comparison between companies of different sizes and highlights changes in business strategy or cost structure.18
Synthesizing the Analysis: Identifying Red Flags
The goal is to integrate all quantitative analysis to spot signs of financial distress or accounting manipulation.28 Key red flags include:
Divergence of Cash Flow and Profit: Net income is positive and growing, but cash flow from operations is weak or negative. This may suggest aggressive revenue recognition or poor working capital management.28
Declining Margins: Consistent erosion of gross or operating margins compared to peers can signal intense competition or operational inefficiencies.36
Rising Leverage: A steady increase in debt-to-equity or debt-to-EBITDA ratios without a corresponding increase in profitability indicates rising financial risk.36
Unusual Inventory Growth: Inventory growing much faster than sales can indicate obsolete products or sales challenges.36
Table 1: Key Financial Ratios for Credit Analysis








Ratio Category
Ratio Name
Formula
Interpretation (What it measures)
Creditor's Perspective (Why it matters for repayment risk)
Liquidity
Current Ratio
Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets.
A ratio below 1.0x signals a potential inability to meet immediate obligations, like interest payments or maturing debt.


Quick Ratio
(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
A stricter measure of liquidity, excluding less-liquid inventory.
Shows if the company can meet short-term obligations without relying on selling inventory, which can be difficult in a downturn.
Solvency/Leverage
Debt-to-Assets
Total Debt / Total Assets
The percentage of a company's assets financed through debt.
A high ratio indicates high leverage and greater risk to creditors in a liquidation scenario, as there are fewer assets per dollar of debt.


Debt-to-Equity
Total Debt / Total Equity
The proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing.
Measures the company's reliance on borrowed funds versus owner's capital. A high ratio signifies a smaller equity cushion to absorb losses.


Debt-to-EBITDA
Total Debt / EBITDA
How many years it would take to repay total debt from EBITDA.
A primary covenant metric. A high or rising ratio indicates an elevated debt burden relative to cash-generating ability.
Coverage
Interest Coverage
EBIT / Interest Expense
Ability of operating earnings to cover interest payments.
A low ratio (e.g., < 2.0x) is a major red flag, indicating a thin margin of safety for making interest payments.


Debt Service Coverage
(EBITDA - CapEx) / (Principal + Interest Payments)
Ability of operational cash flow to cover all debt service.
The most direct measure of repayment capacity. A ratio below 1.0x means the company is not generating enough cash to service its debt.
Profitability
EBITDA Margin
EBITDA / Revenue
A proxy for operating cash flow profitability before capital structure impacts.
Shows the fundamental profitability of the core business. Stable or expanding margins are positive signs for future cash flow generation.


Return on Assets (ROA)
Net Income / Total Assets
Efficiency in using assets to generate profit.
A declining ROA may indicate inefficient asset management or deteriorating profitability, impacting long-term viability.


Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Trainees are given three years of financial statements for two companies in the same industry: "StableCo" and "GrowthCo." They are required to build an Excel spreadsheet to calculate the key ratios from Table 1 for both companies for all three years. They must then write a one-page memo comparing the two companies, highlighting trends, and concluding which company represents a lower credit risk and why, justifying their conclusion with specific ratio analysis.

Assessment Method

Review of the submitted Excel model for accuracy of calculations and the written memo for the quality of analysis, clarity of argument, and ability to synthesize data into a coherent credit recommendation.

1.4 Essential Economic & Market Concepts

This sub-module broadens the analyst's perspective beyond the individual company to the wider economic environment. It introduces the key macroeconomic indicators and market signals that shape the landscape of credit risk, emphasizing that even a financially sound company can fail in a severe economic downturn.

Learning Objectives

Identify the key macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, interest rates, unemployment) and explain their impact on corporate credit quality.
Describe the relationship between the business cycle and the credit cycle.
Interpret the shape of the Treasury yield curve (normal, flat, inverted) and explain its significance as a leading economic indicator.
Define credit spreads and explain how their widening or narrowing reflects changes in market-perceived credit risk.

Key Concepts Outline

The Macroeconomic Backdrop: No Company is an Island
The overall health of the economy is a primary driver of corporate performance and credit risk.42
Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Lenders 44:
Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Measures the total economic output. Strong GDP growth is correlated with corporate revenue growth and lower default rates. A contraction in GDP (a recession) is the most significant macroeconomic risk for a loan portfolio.43
Inflation (CPI, PCE): Measures the rate of price increases. High inflation can compress corporate profit margins by raising input costs (materials, labor) and can erode consumer purchasing power, reducing demand.44
Unemployment Rate: A key indicator of the health of the consumer. High unemployment reduces consumer spending, directly impacting companies in consumer-facing sectors.43
Interest Rates (e.g., Federal Funds Rate): Set by the central bank, these rates influence the cost of borrowing for all companies. Rising rates increase the interest expense for companies with floating-rate debt, reducing their cash flow available for repayment.42
Understanding Business and Credit Cycles
Economies move in cycles of expansion, peak, contraction (recession), and trough.45
The credit cycle follows the business cycle. During expansions, credit is readily available and defaults are low. During contractions, lenders tighten standards and default rates rise, often peaking after a recession has begun.46 A key part of an analyst's job is to understand where we are in the cycle to anticipate future risk.
Market-Based Indicators: The Yield Curve
Definition: A line that plots the interest rates (yields) of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. The U.S. Treasury yield curve is the global benchmark, representing the "risk-free" rate of return.48
Interpreting the Shape:
Normal Yield Curve: Upward-sloping; long-term yields are higher than short-term yields. This is typical of a healthy, growing economy.48
Flat Yield Curve: Short-term and long-term yields are very close. Often signals economic uncertainty or a transition period.49
Inverted Yield Curve: Downward-sloping; short-term yields are higher than long-term yields. This is a rare and powerful signal that the bond market expects an economic slowdown or recession, as it anticipates the central bank will need to cut interest rates in the future.48 An inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession for the past 50 years.
Market-Based Indicators: Credit Spreads
Definition: The difference between the yield on a corporate bond and the yield on a risk-free Treasury bond of the same maturity. It is the extra return investors demand to compensate for credit risk.53
Interpreting Spread Movements:
Widening Spreads: The gap between corporate and Treasury yields increases. This means investors perceive greater risk of default and are demanding more compensation. It is a negative signal for credit quality and often occurs during economic uncertainty.54
Narrowing (Tightening) Spreads: The gap decreases. This means investors perceive lower risk and are more confident in the economic outlook. It is a positive signal for credit quality.54
Spreads as an Early Warning System: Changes in a company's credit spread often act as a leading indicator of its financial health, reflecting real-time market sentiment. A sharp widening of a company's spreads can signal problems long before they appear in its quarterly financial statements.55

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with a chart of the U.S. Treasury yield curve from three different time periods: one normal, one flat, and one inverted. Also, provide a chart showing the historical average credit spread for BBB-rated industrial bonds. Trainees must write a short memo explaining what each yield curve shape implies about the market's expectation for future economic growth. They must then analyze a scenario where the current BBB spread is 200 basis points above its historical average and explain what this signifies about perceived credit risk in the market.

Assessment Method

A quiz that tests the definitions of key macroeconomic indicators and their impact on borrowers. It will include questions requiring the interpretation of a sample inverted yield curve and a scenario of widening credit spreads, asking the trainee to select the most likely implication for credit risk.

Module 2: The Analyst's Toolkit

This module transitions from foundational concepts to the core practical tools and analytical frameworks that credit analysts use daily. Participants will learn to build robust financial models, conduct rigorous qualitative analysis of a company's business and industry, and master the nuances of cash flow forecasting—the ultimate determinant of repayment capacity.

2.1 Financial Modeling in Excel

This sub-module provides hands-on training in building a dynamic, three-statement financial model. The focus is on best practices for structure, logic, and functionality, creating a tool that is not only accurate but also flexible, transparent, and easy to audit.

Learning Objectives

Apply financial modeling best practices for layout, formatting, and structure to create professional, easy-to-follow models.
Build a fully integrated three-statement projection model (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) from historical data.
Construct supporting schedules for debt and interest, ensuring they link correctly to the core financial statements and handle circular references.
Incorporate scenario and sensitivity analysis functionality to test the model's outputs against changes in key assumptions.

Key Concepts Outline

Financial Modeling Best Practices
Structure and Layout: Using a single-worksheet structure with clear separation of inputs, calculations, and outputs is recommended to reduce linking errors and improve navigability.56 Use color-coding (e.g., blue for inputs, black for formulas) to distinguish between assumptions and calculations.
Clarity and Simplicity: Avoid overly complex formulas. Break down calculations into logical steps. The goal is a model that another analyst can easily understand and audit.58
Avoiding Hard-Coding: Inputs and assumptions should be in a dedicated section and linked into the model. Never type a number directly into a formula.
Building the Three-Statement Model
Step 1: Input Historical Data: Populate the model with at least three years of historical data from the company's financial statements.56
Step 2: Create the Assumptions Section: Calculate historical ratios and growth rates (e.g., revenue growth, margins, working capital days) to inform forecast assumptions.56 This section will drive the entire forecast.
Step 3: Project the Income Statement: Forecast revenue based on growth assumptions. Project expenses based on margin assumptions (e.g., COGS as a % of revenue) down to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT).56 Interest and taxes will be calculated later.
Step 4: Project the Balance Sheet (Non-Debt/Cash Items):
Forecast Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) using a roll-forward schedule: Beginning PP&E+CapEx−Depreciation=Ending PP&E.56
Forecast working capital accounts (AR, Inventory, AP) based on assumptions like Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days Inventory Held (DIH), and Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).59
Forecast other assets and liabilities based on historical relationships or specific guidance.
Step 5: Build the Debt and Interest Schedule:
Create a "corkscrew" schedule that links beginning and ending debt balances.57
Beginning Debt+New Borrowings−Repayments=Ending Debt.
Calculate interest expense based on the average or beginning debt balance and the assumed interest rate.56 This creates a circular reference, as interest expense affects net income, which affects cash flow available for debt repayment, which in turn affects the debt balance.
Handling Circularity: Use Excel's iterative calculation setting or a "circularity breaker" switch to manage this.57
Step 6: Complete the Cash Flow Statement:
Start with Net Income (from the projected Income Statement).
Add back non-cash charges like Depreciation & Amortization.
Incorporate changes in working capital accounts from the Balance Sheet forecast.
Subtract Capital Expenditures (CapEx).
Incorporate debt borrowings and repayments from the debt schedule.
Step 7: Link Cash to the Balance Sheet: The ending cash balance from the Cash Flow Statement becomes the cash balance on the ending Balance Sheet. The final check is to ensure the Balance Sheet balances (Assets=Liabilities+Equity) for all forecast years.58
Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity Analysis: Analyzes the impact of changing a single input variable (e.g., revenue growth rate) on a key output (e.g., Net Income or Ending Cash). This helps identify the model's most critical drivers.61 Often displayed using a data table.
Scenario Analysis: Involves changing multiple input variables simultaneously to model different potential futures, such as a "Base Case," "Upside Case," and "Downside Case".61 This is crucial for stress-testing a company's ability to service debt in a recessionary environment.

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Building on the "StableCo" vs. "GrowthCo" case from Module 1.3, trainees will use the provided historical financial statements for StableCo to build a five-year, three-statement projection model in Excel. The exercise will require them to create an assumptions tab, project all three statements, build a simple debt and interest schedule, and ensure the balance sheet balances.

Assessment Method

Submission of the completed Excel model. The model will be reviewed for:
Correctness: Do all formulas calculate correctly?
Linkages: Are the three statements properly integrated?
Best Practices: Is the model well-structured, clearly formatted, and easy to follow?
Balancing: Does the balance sheet balance in all forecast years?

2.2 Business & Industry Risk Analysis

This sub-module equips analysts with qualitative frameworks to assess the risks that are not immediately apparent in the financial statements. The focus is on understanding the competitive landscape, the company's strategic positioning within that landscape, and the quality of its management.

Learning Objectives

Apply Porter's Five Forces framework to analyze the competitive intensity and profitability of an industry.
Conduct a SWOT analysis to identify a company's key internal Strengths and Weaknesses and external Opportunities and Threats.
Analyze an industry's cyclicality and identify its primary growth drivers to understand its sensitivity to the business cycle.
Assess a company's competitive position (e.g., market leader, niche player) and the credibility of its management strategy.

Key Concepts Outline

Industry Analysis: Porter's Five Forces
A framework for understanding the forces that shape competition within an industry, which ultimately determine its attractiveness and average profitability.64
The Five Forces 65:
Threat of New Entrants: How easy is it for new competitors to enter the market? High barriers to entry (e.g., high capital requirements, strong brand loyalty, patents) protect existing firms and are favorable for credit quality.65
Bargaining Power of Buyers: How much power do customers have to drive down prices? Power is high when buyers are concentrated, products are undifferentiated, and switching costs are low.64
Bargaining Power of Suppliers: How much power do suppliers have to raise input prices? Power is high when suppliers are concentrated, the input is critical, and there are no substitutes.64
Threat of Substitute Products or Services: How likely is it that customers will switch to a different type of product or service that meets the same basic need? (e.g., video conferencing as a substitute for air travel).64
Rivalry Among Existing Competitors: How intense is the competition between existing firms? Rivalry is high when there are many competitors of similar size, industry growth is slow, and products are commodities.66
Credit Perspective: Industries with strong competitive forces (e.g., high rivalry, low barriers to entry) tend to have lower, more volatile profitability, which translates to higher credit risk.
Company-Specific Analysis: SWOT Framework
A strategic planning tool that helps organize an assessment of a company's internal and external factors.68 It is a useful framework for summarizing qualitative findings in a credit memo.69
Internal Factors:
Strengths: Internal attributes that give the company a competitive advantage (e.g., strong brand, proprietary technology, efficient operations).69
Weaknesses: Internal attributes that place the company at a disadvantage (e.g., outdated technology, high cost structure, inexperienced management).69
External Factors:
Opportunities: External factors the company could exploit to its advantage (e.g., new markets, favorable regulatory changes, changing consumer tastes).69
Threats: External factors that could harm the company (e.g., economic downturn, new competitors, technological disruption).69
Credit Perspective: The analysis helps identify key risks (from Weaknesses and Threats) and potential mitigants (from Strengths and Opportunities).71
Analyzing Industry Cyclicality and Growth Drivers
Cyclical vs. Non-Cyclical Industries:
Cyclical Industries: Highly sensitive to the business cycle. Revenues are strong during economic expansions but fall sharply during recessions (e.g., automotive, airlines, construction).45 These industries carry higher inherent credit risk.
Non-Cyclical (Defensive) Industries: Relatively stable performance regardless of the economic cycle, as they provide essential goods and services (e.g., utilities, healthcare, consumer staples).45 These industries carry lower inherent credit risk.
Identifying Growth Drivers: Understanding what fuels an industry's growth (e.g., population growth, technological innovation, regulatory changes) is key to forecasting its future prospects.72
Assessing Competitive Position and Management Strategy
Competitive Position: Is the company a market leader with significant scale and pricing power, a niche player with a defensible position, or a weak competitor with no clear advantage?.10
Management Assessment: A qualitative but critical evaluation of the management team's experience, track record, and strategic credibility. Analysts assess management's ability to formulate and execute a sound business strategy.10

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Trainees are assigned an industry (e.g., the U.S. airline industry). They are required to use publicly available information (e.g., industry reports, news articles) to conduct a Porter's Five Forces analysis. They must write a one-page summary evaluating the overall attractiveness of the industry from a creditor's perspective, concluding whether it is a high-risk or low-risk industry to lend to and why.

Assessment Method

Evaluation of the submitted Porter's Five Forces analysis. The assessment will focus on the trainee's ability to identify the key drivers for each force, use evidence to support their analysis, and draw a logical conclusion about the industry's inherent credit risk.

2.3 Cash Flow Forecasting

This sub-module focuses on the most critical element of credit analysis: forecasting a company's ability to generate cash. It emphasizes the crucial distinction between accounting profit (like EBITDA) and true, discretionary cash flow, and provides a structured approach to projecting the key drivers of cash generation.

Learning Objectives

Articulate the critical differences between EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, and explain why Free Cash Flow is a superior measure of debt repayment capacity.
Construct a forecast of Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) based on projections of operating profit, taxes, and investments.
Develop methodologies for projecting future working capital investment based on operational drivers.
Differentiate between maintenance and growth capital expenditures (CapEx) and explain the importance of this distinction in forecasting.

Key Concepts Outline

EBITDA vs. True Cash Flow: A Critical Distinction
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization): Often used as a proxy for cash flow, but it is a flawed measure of cash-generating ability.75
Shortcomings of EBITDA: It is an accounting metric, not a cash flow metric. It crucially ignores two major cash uses 78:
Changes in Net Working Capital: A growing company often consumes cash by investing in more inventory and receivables.
Capital Expenditures (CapEx): Companies must spend cash to maintain and grow their asset base.
Free Cash Flow (FCF): A much more accurate measure of the cash available to service debt and provide returns to all capital providers (both debt and equity). It explicitly accounts for the cash uses that EBITDA ignores.75
Forecasting Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)
FCFF represents the cash flow generated by a company before considering the effects of financing (i.e., before interest payments and net debt borrowings/repayments). It is the cash available to all capital providers.
Standard Formula 79:

FCFF=EBIT×(1−Tax Rate)+Depreciation & Amortization−Capital Expenditures−ΔNet Working Capital
EBIT×(1−Tax Rate): Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT), the unlevered operating profit of the business.
+D&A: Add back non-cash charges.
−CapEx: Subtract cash spent on fixed assets.
−ΔNWC: Subtract cash invested in operating assets like inventory and receivables.
Projecting the Drivers of Cash Flow
Forecasting Working Capital Investment:
The change in Net Working Capital (ΔNWC) is a key driver of cash flow.
Projections should be based on operating assumptions, not just a simple historical average.
Forecast individual components (AR, Inventory, AP) as a percentage of revenue or COGS, or using "days" metrics (DSO, DIH, DPO).82 For example, if revenue is projected to grow by 10%, it is logical to assume Accounts Receivable will also grow, representing a use of cash.
Projecting Capital Expenditures (CapEx):
CapEx is a critical cash outflow needed to sustain and grow the business.
Maintenance vs. Growth CapEx: A crucial distinction for credit analysis.82
Maintenance CapEx: The amount required to sustain the company's current level of operations (e.g., replacing old machinery). This is a non-discretionary expenditure. In the long run, it often approximates depreciation expense.
Growth CapEx: Discretionary spending to expand the business (e.g., building a new factory).
Analysts must ensure their forecast includes sufficient maintenance CapEx to support the business's ongoing viability. Projections can be based on historical trends as a percentage of sales or management guidance.82

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Using the three-statement model for "StableCo" built in sub-module 2.1, trainees will add a new section to calculate and forecast Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) for the five-year projection period. They will be required to explicitly forecast maintenance CapEx (assuming it equals depreciation) and growth CapEx (based on a percentage of revenue growth). They will also project the change in Net Working Capital based on their existing balance sheet forecast.

Assessment Method

Review of the updated Excel model. The assessment will focus on the correct calculation of the FCFF formula and the logical consistency of the underlying projections for CapEx and working capital. A short written question will ask the trainee to explain why the projected FCFF for StableCo is consistently lower than its projected EBITDA.

Module 3: The Credit Underwriting Process

This module immerses the analyst in the core activities of the underwriting process. Having built the foundational and analytical toolkit, participants will now learn how to deploy these skills in a real-world context: gathering information, constructing a persuasive analytical argument, and understanding the legal framework that protects the lender's interests.

3.1 Due Diligence & Information Gathering

This sub-module focuses on the systematic process of collecting and verifying the information necessary to conduct a thorough credit analysis. It covers primary documents, public filings, and the critical process of preparing for and engaging with company management.

Learning Objectives

Develop and utilize a comprehensive due diligence checklist to systematically gather required financial, legal, and operational information.
Analyze key sections of SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) to extract critical information on business strategy, risk factors, and financial details.
Effectively use third-party industry reports to benchmark a company's performance and understand market trends.
Formulate insightful and targeted questions for management calls to probe key areas of credit risk and validate assumptions.

Key Concepts Outline

The Purpose of Due Diligence
Due diligence is the process of investigation and verification undertaken to confirm all material facts in a transaction.83
For a lender, its purpose is to uncover any legal or financial risks that could endanger the repayment of the loan, ensuring the lender makes an informed decision.83 It can lead to changes in loan terms, collateral, or even a decision to withdraw from the deal.83
Creating a Due Diligence Checklist
A systematic checklist ensures no crucial aspect is overlooked.84 The level of detail depends on the complexity of the transaction.84
Key Categories for a Credit Due Diligence Checklist 85:
Corporate & Legal: Articles of incorporation, bylaws, organizational charts, shareholder lists, good standing certificates.87
Financial Information: Audited financial statements (3-5 years), recent interim statements, tax returns, detailed schedules of debt, accounts receivable aging, and accounts payable aging.84
Assets & Collateral: Schedules of all real estate, equipment, and inventory; copies of leases, deeds, and appraisals.85
Material Contracts: Key customer contracts, supplier agreements, employment agreements for key management.84
Intellectual Property: Schedule of patents, trademarks, and licenses.85
Litigation: A summary of any pending or threatened legal action against the company.85
Analyzing SEC Filings (10-K and 10-Q)
These are primary sources of detailed information for publicly traded companies, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.90 The 10-K is an annual, audited report, while the 10-Q is a quarterly, unaudited report.92
Key Sections for Credit Analysts 90:
Item 1: Business: A detailed description of the company's operations, products, markets, and competitive landscape. Essential for understanding the business model.
Item 1A: Risk Factors: Management's own assessment of the most significant risks facing the company. This is required reading for any analyst.
Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A): Management's narrative explanation of the financial results. It provides context for the numbers, discusses trends, and outlines future outlook and known uncertainties. Crucial for understanding the "why" behind performance changes.
Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: The audited financial statements and the all-important Notes to the Financial Statements.
Using Industry Reports and Market Data
Utilizing reports from market research firms to understand industry size, growth trends, competitive dynamics, and profitability benchmarks.73
This provides essential context for evaluating a company's performance. A company growing at 2% may seem weak, but if its industry is shrinking by 5%, that 2% growth is a sign of strength.
Preparing for Management Calls
The management call is an opportunity to clarify questions that arise from the document review and to assess the quality and credibility of the management team.74
Preparation is Key: An analyst should never go into a management call unprepared. The process involves:
Thoroughly reviewing all financial and legal documents first.
Identifying inconsistencies, anomalies, or areas needing further explanation.
Developing a structured list of open-ended questions.
Sample Question Areas 95:
On Performance: "Your revenues increased by 15% last year, but EBITDA margins declined by 200 basis points. Can you walk me through the key drivers of that margin compression?"
On Strategy: "What are your top 2-3 strategic priorities for the next 18 months, and what are the biggest risks to achieving them?"
On Financial Policy: "What is your target leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA), and how do you plan to manage the capital structure going forward?"
On Industry Conditions: "How are you seeing the current competitive landscape, and how is your company positioned to handle pricing pressure from new entrants?"

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Trainees are provided with the 10-K for a company and a blank due diligence checklist template. Their task is to populate the checklist by identifying where in the 10-K each piece of requested information can be found (e.g., "Schedule of Debt Maturities - See Note 8 to the Financial Statements"). They must also draft five key questions for a hypothetical management call based on their review of the MD&A and Risk Factors sections.

Assessment Method

Review of the completed due diligence checklist for completeness and accuracy. The quality of the management call questions will be assessed based on their relevance, specificity, and demonstrated understanding of the key credit issues facing the company as disclosed in the 10-K.

3.2 Writing the Credit Memorandum

This sub-module focuses on the crucial skill of communicating the results of the credit analysis. The credit memorandum (or credit memo) is the primary document used to present a lending recommendation to decision-makers. The emphasis is on creating a clear, concise, and persuasive narrative that logically supports a final recommendation.

Learning Objectives

Structure a credit memorandum logically, including all essential components from the executive summary to the final recommendation.
Write a concise and impactful executive summary that clearly states the loan request, the credit thesis, and the key risks.
Develop a compelling credit narrative that goes beyond simply restating financial data to explain the "so what" behind the numbers.
Clearly articulate the primary risks in the transaction and propose specific, actionable mitigants to address those risks.

Key Concepts Outline

The Purpose and Function of a Credit Memorandum
The credit memo is the primary means of communication within a bank for credit decisions.98
It serves three main functions: 1) to provide a comprehensive analysis of a customer relationship and loan request, 2) to create a formal record of the analyst's thoughts and actions, and 3) to support a specific recommendation (approve, decline, or modify) to the loan committee.98
Structuring a Compelling Credit Narrative
An effective credit memo tells a story. It should not be a simple regurgitation of data but a narrative that explains the borrower's history, current situation, and future prospects, all through the lens of repayment capacity.99
Key Building Blocks of the Memo 99:
Executive Summary / Request: A concise, top-level overview.
Borrower & Management Background: Who is the company and who is running it?
Loan Structure & Purpose: What is the loan for and how is it structured?
Industry & Market Analysis: What are the external conditions?
Financial Analysis: A detailed analysis of historical and projected performance, focusing on cash flow and key ratios.
Collateral Analysis: Evaluation of the secondary source of repayment.
Risks & Mitigants: The heart of the risk assessment.
Final Recommendation & Risk Rating: The ultimate conclusion.
Writing the Executive Summary: The "So What" Up Front
Many decision-makers will form their opinion based on the first page. The executive summary must be clear, concise, and impactful.99
Essential Components 103:
The Request: Clearly state the borrower, the loan amount, and the purpose (e.g., "XYZ Corp. requests a $10 million term loan to finance the acquisition of ABC Company.").
The Credit Thesis: In 2-3 sentences, explain the core reason why this is a good loan (e.g., "The acquisition will enhance XYZ's market position and generate significant cost synergies, leading to strong pro-forma cash flow sufficient to service the proposed debt.").
Key Strengths: Bullet points highlighting the main positive factors (e.g., experienced management, strong historical performance).
Key Risks & Mitigants: Bullet points identifying the primary risks and how they are addressed (e.g., "Risk: Integration of the acquisition. Mitigant: Management has a successful track record of integrating past acquisitions.").
Recommendation: A clear statement of the proposed action (e.g., "Approval is recommended subject to the terms and conditions outlined herein.").
Articulating Risks and Mitigants
This section demonstrates the analyst's critical thinking. It's not enough to list risks; one must propose concrete ways to mitigate them.101
Risk: A potential future event that could impair the borrower's ability to repay (e.g., customer concentration, industry downturn, rising interest rates).
Mitigant: A structural feature of the loan or a strength of the borrower that reduces the likelihood or impact of that risk (e.g., personal guarantees from owners, strong collateral coverage, financial covenants, interest rate hedges).
The analysis should focus on the 3-5 largest risks, not every conceivable risk.101

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Using the completed analysis from the "StableCo" case study (Modules 1.3 and 2.1), trainees are tasked with writing a full credit memorandum. They will be provided with a standard bank template and must populate all sections, including writing a compelling executive summary, detailing their financial analysis, and identifying at least three key risks with corresponding mitigants.

Assessment Method

Submission of the full credit memorandum. The memo will be graded on:
Clarity and Conciseness: Especially in the executive summary.
Logical Flow: Does the narrative build a coherent argument?
Depth of Analysis: Does the memo go beyond surface-level data to provide insight?
Risk Identification: Are the key risks correctly identified and are the proposed mitigants realistic and effective?

3.3 Financial Covenants & Documentation

This sub-module introduces the legal underpinnings of a credit relationship. It demystifies the credit agreement, focusing on the key provisions that protect the lender. The primary focus is on financial covenants—the performance metrics a borrower must maintain to remain in good standing.

Learning Objectives

Identify and describe the key sections of a standard credit agreement (e.g., Definitions, Loan Terms, Covenants, Events of Default).
Differentiate between affirmative covenants (what the borrower must do) and negative covenants (what the borrower cannot do).
Define the most common financial covenants, including Leverage and Interest Coverage ratios.
Calculate a company's compliance with its financial covenants using data from its financial statements and the specific definitions in the credit agreement.

Key Concepts Outline

Introduction to the Credit Agreement
The credit agreement (or facilities agreement) is the legally binding contract that governs the terms of the loan.106
Key Sections for an Analyst to Understand 106:
Article 1: Definitions: Crucial section that defines all key terms used in the agreement, including the precise calculation for financial covenants (e.g., the definition of "EBITDA" or "Debt").
Article 2: The Commitments and Credit Extensions: Details the loan amounts, types of loans (e.g., revolver, term loan), interest rates, fees, and repayment schedules.
Article 4: Conditions Precedent: Items that must be completed before the loan can be funded.
Article 5: Representations and Warranties: Statements of fact made by the borrower about its business and financial condition at the time the loan is made. A breach can trigger a default.
Article 7: Covenants: The rules of the road for the borrower during the life of the loan.
Article 8: Events of Default: Specific events that constitute a breach of the agreement, giving the lender the right to take remedial action (e.g., accelerate repayment).
Understanding Covenants: The Rules of the Road
Covenants are promises made by the borrower to the lender, designed to protect the lender's investment by ensuring the borrower operates in a financially sound manner.109
Affirmative (Positive) Covenants: Specify actions the borrower must take.109 Examples include:
Providing regular financial statements (quarterly and annual).
Paying taxes on time.
Maintaining proper insurance.
Maintaining corporate existence.
Negative Covenants: Specify actions the borrower cannot take without the lender's consent. These are designed to prevent actions that could increase the lender's risk.109 Examples include:
Limitation on Liens: Prevents the borrower from pledging assets to other creditors.
Limitation on Indebtedness: Restricts the amount of additional debt the borrower can incur.
Limitation on Asset Sales: Restricts the sale of significant assets.
Limitation on Restricted Payments: Limits the amount of cash that can be paid out to shareholders as dividends or for share buybacks.
Financial Covenants: The Performance Scorecard
These are numerical tests, typically calculated quarterly, that measure the borrower's financial health against pre-defined thresholds.110 A breach of a financial covenant is a clear early warning sign of deteriorating performance.112
Common Financial Covenants and Their Calculation 111:
Leverage Ratio (Maximum): Measures the level of debt relative to cash flow.
Formula: Total Debt/EBITDA≤X.Xx
Example: If the covenant is ≤3.50x and the company's ratio is 3.75x, it is in breach.
Interest Coverage Ratio (Minimum): Measures the ability of cash flow to cover interest expense.
Formula: EBITDA/Total Interest Expense≥X.Xx
Example: If the covenant is ≥2.50x and the company's ratio is 2.25x, it is in breach.
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (Minimum): A broader measure of repayment capacity.
Formula: (EBITDA−Unfunded CapEx−Taxes)/(Interest+Scheduled Principal Payments)≥X.Xx
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (Minimum): Similar to DSCR but often includes other fixed charges like lease payments.111

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with a one-page excerpt from a credit agreement's "Definitions" and "Financial Covenants" sections. The excerpt defines "Consolidated EBITDA" and "Total Debt" and sets a maximum Leverage Ratio of 4.00x. Also provide a company's simplified income statement and balance sheet. The task is to use the specific definitions from the credit agreement to calculate Consolidated EBITDA, Total Debt, and the Leverage Ratio, and then determine if the company is in compliance with its covenant.

Assessment Method

A quiz requiring trainees to identify whether specific clauses are affirmative, negative, or financial covenants. The primary assessment will be the review of the covenant calculation exercise for accuracy, particularly the trainee's ability to follow the precise definitions from the sample credit agreement.

Module 4: Advanced Credit & Risk Topics

This module builds on the core underwriting process by introducing more complex and specialized areas of corporate credit. Participants will explore the high-stakes world of leveraged finance, delve into the intricacies of debt structuring and capital hierarchy, and learn the critical post-closing functions of credit monitoring and early risk detection.

4.1 Introduction to Leveraged Finance & LBOs

This sub-module provides an introduction to highly leveraged transactions, focusing on the mechanics of a Leveraged Buyout (LBO) and the key credit considerations that differentiate these deals from standard corporate lending.

Learning Objectives

Define leveraged finance and identify the characteristics of a typical leveraged transaction.
Explain the mechanics of a Leveraged Buyout (LBO), including the roles of the financial sponsor and various lenders.
Construct a simple Sources and Uses of Funds table for an LBO transaction.
Identify the key credit metrics and structural features that are critical for analyzing highly leveraged companies.

Key Concepts Outline

Defining Leveraged Finance
Leveraged finance involves the use of an above-normal amount of debt to finance transactions such as acquisitions, recapitalizations, or buyouts.115
Borrowers are typically rated below investment-grade (BB+ or lower) and are characterized by high debt levels relative to their cash flow.117
The goal for the equity investor (often a private equity firm) is to use leverage to amplify their returns on equity, targeting an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 20-30% or more.118
Basics of a Leveraged Buyout (LBO)
An LBO is the acquisition of a company where the purchase price is financed primarily with debt.119
The assets of the acquired company are used as collateral for the loans.118
Value Creation in an LBO: Returns for the private equity sponsor are generated through three main levers:
Deleveraging: Using the company's cash flow to pay down debt, thereby increasing the equity value over time.119
EBITDA Growth: Improving the company's operations to increase its profitability and cash flow.120
Multiple Expansion: Selling the company at the end of the investment period for a higher valuation multiple (e.g., EV/EBITDA) than it was purchased for.119
Characteristics of a Good LBO Candidate: Stable and predictable cash flows, strong market position, experienced management team, and opportunities for operational improvements.119
Sources and Uses of Funds
A fundamental table in any LBO model that outlines how the transaction is financed and where the money is spent. The total sources must always equal the total uses.122
Uses of Funds (Where the money goes):
Purchase of Target's Equity: The primary cost of the acquisition.
Refinancing of Target's Existing Debt: The buyer must typically repay the target's old debt.
Transaction Fees & Expenses: Fees paid to lawyers, accountants, and investment bankers.123
Sources of Funds (Where the money comes from):
New Debt Instruments: Revolver, Term Loans, High-Yield Bonds, etc.
Sponsor Equity: The cash invested by the private equity firm (the "plug" that makes sources equal uses).123
Rollover Equity: Equity retained by the target's existing management or owners.123
Key Credit Considerations in Leveraged Transactions
High Leverage: The primary risk. Debt/EBITDA ratios are significantly higher than in investment-grade companies, leaving little room for error or underperformance.118
Cash Flow Analysis: Repayment capacity is paramount. The analysis must rigorously stress-test the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to cover high interest payments and mandatory debt amortization.125
Structure and Covenants: The structure of the debt (e.g., security, seniority) and the strength of the covenants are critical protections for lenders. "Cov-lite" loans, which have fewer financial covenants, have become more common but represent higher risk for lenders.117
Exit Strategy: Since the sponsor's goal is to sell the business in 5-7 years, the lender must be confident in the viability of the exit plan (e.g., sale to another company, IPO).119

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with a simplified LBO scenario: a private equity firm is acquiring a company for an enterprise value of $500 million, which is 10.0x the company's EBITDA of $50 million. The target has $100 million of existing debt that must be refinanced. Transaction fees are $15 million. The financing will consist of a $250 million Term Loan and a $100 million High-Yield Bond. Trainees must build a Sources and Uses table in Excel and calculate the amount of sponsor equity required to fund the deal.

Assessment Method

Review of the submitted Sources and Uses table for correct structure and accurate calculations. A short-answer question will ask trainees to calculate the pro-forma Debt/EBITDA ratio and comment on whether it represents a high or low level of leverage.

4.2 Debt Structuring & Capital Structure

This sub-module provides a detailed examination of how a company's liabilities are organized. It explains the concept of the "capital stack" and the principle of priority of payment, which are fundamental to assessing recovery prospects in a default scenario.

Learning Objectives

Illustrate the capital structure hierarchy and explain the principle of absolute priority in a bankruptcy scenario.
Differentiate between the key features of various corporate debt instruments, including revolvers, term loans, and bonds.
Define structural subordination and explain how it can impact a creditor's claim on assets.
Analyze a company's capital structure to determine the relative seniority and security of a specific debt instrument.

Key Concepts Outline

The Capital Structure Hierarchy (The "Capital Stack")
Capital structure refers to the mix of debt and equity a company uses to finance its assets.126
The hierarchy, or "stack," represents the priority of claims on a company's assets and cash flows in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. Instruments at the top of the stack have the highest priority and are the least risky; those at the bottom have the lowest priority and are the most risky.128
The Principle of Absolute Priority: In a bankruptcy, creditors at the top of the hierarchy must be paid in full before any value can be distributed to the class below them.128
Typical Hierarchy (from highest to lowest priority):
Senior Secured Debt (e.g., Revolvers, Term Loan A, Term Loan B): Has the first claim on company assets, specifically on the collateral pledged to secure the debt.128
Senior Unsecured Debt (e.g., High-Yield Bonds): Has a general claim on the company's assets but ranks behind secured creditors with respect to the pledged collateral.128
Subordinated Debt (e.g., Mezzanine Debt): Contractually ranks behind senior debt. Holders are only paid after all senior creditors are satisfied.129
Preferred Stock: A hybrid instrument that ranks ahead of common stock but behind all debt.
Common Equity: The residual claimants. Equity holders are paid last and often receive nothing in a bankruptcy.127
Understanding Different Debt Instruments
Companies use a variety of debt instruments to meet different financing needs.131
Bank Debt (Senior Loans):
Revolving Credit Facility (Revolver): A corporate credit card used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The company can borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to a specified limit. Typically senior secured.115
Term Loan A (TLA): An amortizing loan, meaning the principal is paid down gradually over the life of the loan. Typically held by banks and has a shorter maturity (e.g., 5-7 years).115
Term Loan B (TLB): A loan with minimal principal amortization (e.g., 1% per year) and a large "bullet" payment at maturity. Typically held by institutional investors like CLOs and has a longer maturity than a TLA.121
Bonds (Notes):
High-Yield Bonds: Unsecured debt sold to institutional investors. Typically have fixed interest rates, bullet maturities (no amortization), and less restrictive "incurrence" covenants.115
Mezzanine Debt: A subordinated instrument that often includes an equity component (like warrants) to enhance returns for the investor, compensating for its high risk.118
The Concept of Structural Subordination
This is a critical concept in companies with a holding company (Parent) and operating subsidiary structure.134
Definition: Creditors who lend to the Parent company are structurally subordinated to creditors who lend directly to the operating Subsidiary. In a bankruptcy, the Subsidiary's creditors must be paid in full from the Subsidiary's assets before any remaining value (as equity) can be distributed "upstream" to the Parent to pay its creditors.135
Mitigant: To overcome structural subordination, lenders to a holding company will almost always require the operating subsidiaries to provide an "upstream guarantee" of the parent's debt, making them directly liable as well.130

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with an organizational chart for a company with a holding company ("HoldCo") and two operating subsidiaries ("OpCo 1" and "OpCo 2"). The capital structure includes a Term Loan B at OpCo 1 and Senior Unsecured Bonds issued by HoldCo. Trainees must draw a diagram of the capital structure, rank the instruments by priority, and write a short paragraph explaining why the bondholders are structurally subordinated to the term loan lenders and what legal feature they would seek to mitigate this risk.

Assessment Method

Evaluation of the capital structure diagram and the written explanation for correctness. The assessment will focus on the trainee's ability to correctly identify and explain the concept of structural subordination and its common mitigant (an upstream guarantee).

4.3 Credit Monitoring, Annual Reviews, and Early Warning Signs

This sub-module covers the essential post-closing responsibilities of a credit analyst. It emphasizes that credit analysis is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of monitoring, reassessment, and proactive risk management to identify and address potential problems before they lead to default.

Learning Objectives

Outline the key components and objectives of a formal annual credit review process for a corporate loan.
Describe effective methods for tracking a borrower's compliance with financial covenants on a periodic basis.
Identify a range of quantitative and qualitative early warning signs that may indicate credit deterioration.
Explain the purpose and function of a credit watchlist in managing problem loans within a financial institution.

Key Concepts Outline

The Process for Annual Credit Reviews
An annual (or more frequent) review is a systematic reassessment of a borrower's creditworthiness after a loan has been funded.137
Objectives: To ensure the borrower's risk profile has not materially deteriorated, to confirm compliance with loan terms, and to update the internal risk rating.137
Key Steps in the Review Process 139:
Pre-File Review: Gather all necessary documents, including annual and interim financial statements, compliance certificates, and reports on collateral.
File Review:
Perform a full financial analysis, comparing current performance to the prior year and the original underwriting case.
Recalculate financial covenants to confirm compliance.
Re-evaluate the Five C's of Credit in light of the new information.
Assess the adequacy of collateral value.
Post-File Review: Document the findings in an annual review memo, update the risk rating, and present conclusions to management.
Tracking Covenant Compliance
Monitoring covenant compliance is a critical, ongoing task, typically performed quarterly when financial statements are received.140
Process:
Obtain the borrower's quarterly financial statements and a signed compliance certificate.
Using the precise definitions from the credit agreement, calculate the required financial ratios (e.g., Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio).
Compare the calculated values to the required thresholds in the credit agreement.
Document compliance or any breaches. A breach is an Event of Default and requires immediate attention and escalation.141
Automation: Many institutions use specialized software to automate the tracking and flagging of covenants, reducing manual error and improving efficiency.141
Identifying Early Warning Signs (EWS) of Credit Deterioration
The goal of monitoring is to identify problems early, before a payment default occurs. Analysts must be vigilant for both quantitative and qualitative red flags.143
Financial Warning Signs 144:
Breach of financial covenants.
Sustained decline in revenue or profitability.
Deteriorating margins compared to peers.
Negative or declining cash flow from operations.
Rapid increase in leverage.
Lengthening of the cash conversion cycle (e.g., rising inventory or receivables days).
Missed or late loan payments.
Non-Financial Warning Signs 144:
Unexpected departure of key management (e.g., CEO or CFO).
Frequent changes in auditors or accounting policies.
Loss of a major customer or supplier.
Adverse industry or regulatory developments.
Late or incomplete financial reporting.
Increased need for overdrafts or frequent requests for covenant waivers.
The Role of a Credit Watchlist
A watchlist is an internal list of loans that are exhibiting signs of credit deterioration but are not yet formally classified as non-performing.143
Purpose: To identify borrowers with increased risk for more intensive monitoring and management.143
Process: When an analyst identifies a loan with significant early warning signs, they recommend placing it on the watchlist. This triggers more frequent reviews (e.g., monthly), closer contact with the borrower, and the development of a specific action plan to mitigate the risk and improve the credit.143

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide trainees with a case study of a company over three years. Year 1 financials are strong. Year 2 financials show a slight decline in revenue but stable margins. Year 3 financials show a continued revenue decline, a sharp drop in margins, a breach of its leverage covenant, and a footnote disclosure about the loss of its largest customer. Trainees must write a short memo identifying the early warning signs present in Year 2 and the more severe problems in Year 3, and recommend placing the loan on the credit watchlist.

Assessment Method

Evaluation of the submitted memo. The assessment will focus on the trainee's ability to identify both subtle and obvious warning signs of credit deterioration, connect them to underlying business issues, and make a clear, actionable recommendation based on their findings.

Module 5: Professional Development

This final module focuses on the crucial "soft skills" that elevate a good analyst to a great one. It moves beyond technical execution to the higher-order skills of synthesis, judgment, and communication. The objective is to teach analysts how to transform their data and analysis into a compelling, insightful, and defensible credit recommendation.

5.1 Critical Thinking & Forming a Narrative

This sub-module teaches analysts how to move beyond data gathering and calculation to the crucial process of forming an independent, insightful opinion. It focuses on challenging assumptions, identifying key drivers, and synthesizing disparate pieces of information into a coherent and persuasive story.

Learning Objectives

Apply critical thinking techniques to move from data collection to forming an insightful, evidence-based opinion.
Challenge underlying assumptions in financial projections and management presentations.
Synthesize quantitative financial analysis and qualitative business analysis into a single, coherent credit narrative.
Identify the 2-3 key drivers that are most critical to a credit thesis and focus the narrative around them.

Key Concepts Outline

Moving from Data Gathering to Insightful Opinion
Critical thinking is the ability to analyze complex situations, identify problems, and find solutions by dissecting information, identifying patterns, and forming sound judgments.145
It involves moving beyond the "what" (e.g., "revenue declined by 5%") to the "why" (e.g., "revenue declined by 5% because the company lost its largest customer due to quality control issues") and the "so what" (e.g., "this raises concerns about the company's customer concentration and operational controls, which increases repayment risk").99
Challenging Assumptions and Identifying Biases
A core critical thinking skill is to maintain a "trust but verify" mindset and question the underlying assumptions in any analysis, especially management's forecasts.147
Key Questions to Ask 145:
What are the assumptions behind these projections? Are they realistic given the industry outlook and competitive pressures?
Is the data reliable? Has it been audited?
Are there alternative interpretations? Could the same data support a different conclusion?
What are the potential consequences if these assumptions are wrong? (This leads directly to stress testing).
Synthesizing Information into a Coherent Story
Synthesis is the process of integrating support from multiple, disparate sources (e.g., financial ratios, industry analysis, management call notes, SEC filings) to form a single, cohesive argument.148
The goal is to build a "credit narrative" or "credit thesis"—a compelling story that explains the transaction, identifies the key risks, and logically leads to a clear recommendation.100
An effective narrative highlights the company's strengths, acknowledges its weaknesses, and explains how the proposed loan structure mitigates the key risks.100
Identifying Key Drivers
Not all information is equally important. A key skill is to identify the 2-3 most critical factors—the key drivers—that will determine the success or failure of the credit.
The credit memo and presentation should be structured around these key drivers, rather than giving equal weight to dozens of minor points. This focuses the attention of decision-makers on what truly matters.

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

Provide a short, ambiguous case study with conflicting data points (e.g., a company with rapidly growing revenue but deteriorating cash flow and high customer concentration). The task is not to perform calculations but to write a half-page memo that:
Identifies the central problem/question.
Lists the key pieces of conflicting evidence.
Formulates a preliminary credit thesis (narrative) that attempts to reconcile the conflicting data.
Lists the top three questions to ask management to test this thesis.

Assessment Method

Evaluation of the submitted memo based on the clarity of the problem statement, the ability to identify the most salient data points, and the logical coherence of the proposed narrative and follow-up questions. The assessment measures the trainee's ability to think critically and structure an analytical argument.

5.2 Communication & Presentation Skills

This final sub-module prepares the analyst for the critical task of presenting and defending their analysis to decision-makers, such as a loan committee. It focuses on tailoring the message to the audience, presenting data effectively, and confidently handling questions and challenges.

Learning Objectives

Structure and deliver a clear, concise, and persuasive credit recommendation to a committee.
Adapt communication style and content for different audiences (e.g., senior credit officers vs. relationship managers).
Use data visualization and storytelling techniques to make complex financial information understandable and impactful.
Apply a structured approach to confidently defend an analytical viewpoint and respond to challenging questions.

Key Concepts Outline

Presenting a Credit Recommendation to a Committee
The goal is to provide the committee with the information and analysis they need to make an informed decision efficiently.149
Structure of the Presentation:
Start with the Recommendation: Lead with the request and your recommendation. Don't bury the lead.99
Tell the Story: Briefly provide the background of the borrower and the transaction. Focus on the narrative, not just a list of facts.149
Focus on the Key Issues: Highlight the 2-3 key strengths and the 2-3 key risks and their mitigants. This is the core of the discussion.
Be Prepared for Questions: Have a deep understanding of the details, even if they are not in the main presentation.150
Adapting Communication to Different Audiences
A credit committee may include members with different backgrounds and priorities (e.g., Chief Credit Officer, senior lenders, workout specialists).151
The presentation must be tailored to the audience. Senior decision-makers care about the high-level thesis and key risks. Other analysts may want to dig into the details of the financial model.103
Avoid overly technical jargon. Explain complex concepts in simple, direct language.152
Defending an Analytical Viewpoint
Challenging questions are a sign of engagement, not failure. They are an opportunity to demonstrate expertise and conviction.154
The FRAME Technique for Responding to Challenges 154:
F - Focus on the question, not the tone. Remain calm and professional.
R - Reflect the concern back to ensure you understand it ("So, if I understand correctly, you're concerned about the sustainability of the revenue growth...").
A - Acknowledge the business context. Show you understand why it's a valid concern ("That's a fair question, especially given the recent volatility in the industry.").
M - Map your insight to their concern. Bring the discussion back to your evidence-based analysis ("Our analysis of their long-term contracts, which we detail on page 5, provides comfort on that point...").
E - Explain the impact or trade-off. Be transparent about risks and how they are being managed.

Practical Application/Case Study Idea

A role-playing exercise. Trainees are divided into groups. One trainee in each group is tasked with presenting their credit recommendation from the "StableCo" credit memo (from Module 3.2) to the rest of the group, who will act as the loan committee. The committee members are given roles (e.g., "skeptical credit officer," "relationship-focused manager") and a list of challenging questions to ask. The presenter has 10 minutes to make their case and 10 minutes for Q&A.

Assessment Method

Peer and instructor feedback on the role-playing exercise. The presenter will be evaluated on their clarity, persuasiveness, ability to focus on key issues, and effectiveness in responding to questions using a structured approach like FRAME. The committee members will be evaluated on the quality and relevance of their questions.
