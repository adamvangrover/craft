Objective: Create the main directory structure for the "Copilot Quest" project.

Instructions:
1. Create the following directories:
   - `/docs`
   - `/websites/training`
   - `/websites/presentation`
   - `/websites/games/copilot-quest/css`
   - `/websites/games/copilot-quest/js`
   - `/websites/games/copilot-quest/images`
   - `/agents`
2. Trigger the `DocsWriterAgent` to populate the `/docs` directory and the root `README.md`.
3. Trigger the `WebsiteBuilderAgent` to populate the `/websites` directory.
4. Trigger the `PresentationCreatorAgent` to populate the `/websites/presentation` directory.

Developer Notes:
- This agent is the first to be run. It sets up the entire repository structure.
- The order of agent execution is important. The `RepoBuilderAgent` must run before the other agents.
- This agent has been updated to reflect the new, expanded directory structure.
- The `WebsiteBuilderAgent` is now responsible for populating the entire `/websites` directory, not just a single website.
