# Agent Instructions

This directory contains the source code for the presentation websites in the Copilot Quest project. When adding new presentations, please follow these guidelines:

- Create a new directory for each presentation.
- Use a descriptive directory name that summarizes the presentation.
- Include a `README.md` file that explains how to run the presentation.
- Use a standard web development stack, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Ensure that the presentation is responsive and works on all devices.
