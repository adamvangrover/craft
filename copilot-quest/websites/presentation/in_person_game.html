            <h2>Round 1: Risk Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the primary goal of risk management?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> To identify, assess, and mitigate risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Anecdote:</strong> A famous example of risk management failure is the story of the Titanic. The ship's designers knew about the risk of icebergs, but they didn't take it seriously enough. As a result, the ship sank on its maiden voyage, and more than 1,500 people died.</p>

            <h2>Round 1: Risk Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What is a risk matrix?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A tool for ranking and prioritizing risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Anecdote:</strong> A risk matrix is like a weather forecast for your business. It helps you see which storms are coming and how to prepare for them.</p>

            <h2>Round 2: Compliance</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the purpose of a compliance program?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> To ensure that an organization follows all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <p><strong>Anecdote:</strong> In the 1970s, the Ford Pinto was known for its tendency to explode in rear-end collisions. Ford knew about the problem, but they decided not to fix it because it would have been too expensive. As a result, hundreds of people were killed or injured. This is a classic example of what can happen when a company doesn't take compliance seriously.</p>

            <h2>Round 2: Compliance</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What are some of the consequences of non-compliance?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Fines, penalties, and reputational damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Anecdote:</strong> In 2015, Volkswagen was caught cheating on emissions tests. The company was fined billions of dollars, and its reputation was tarnished. This is a reminder that non-compliance can have serious consequences.</p>

            <h2>Round 3: Safety</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the most common cause of workplace accidents?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Slips, trips, and falls.</p>
            <p><strong>Anecdote:</strong> A few years ago, a man in Florida was killed when he fell into a vat of chocolate. This is a tragic reminder that even the most seemingly harmless workplaces can be dangerous.</p>

            <h2>Round 3: Safety</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the purpose of a safety data sheet (SDS)?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> To provide information on the hazards of a chemical and how to handle it safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Anecdote:</strong> In 2013, a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, exploded, killing 15 people and injuring more than 160. The explosion was caused by ammonium nitrate, a chemical that is used in fertilizer. The plant didn't have a proper SDS for ammonium nitrate, so workers didn't know how to handle it safely.</p>
