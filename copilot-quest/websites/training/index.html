            <h2>Guidelines for Using Copilot</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be clear and concise in your prompts.</strong> The more specific you are, the better Copilot will be able to understand your request.</li>
                <li><strong>Review and edit Copilot's suggestions.</strong> Copilot is a powerful tool, but it's not perfect. Always review its suggestions to ensure they are accurate and appropriate.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Copilot as a partner, not a replacement.</strong> Copilot is designed to augment your skills, not replace them. Use it to help you with tedious or repetitive tasks, so you can focus on more creative and strategic work.</li>
                <li><strong>Be aware of potential biases.</strong> Like all AI models, Copilot has the potential to reflect biases present in its training data. Be mindful of this and take steps to mitigate any potential biases in your work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Prompt Tips</h2>
            <p>Here are some tips for writing effective prompts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use natural language.</strong> You don't need to use special syntax or keywords to get good results from Copilot. Just write your prompts in plain English.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide context.</strong> If you're working on a specific project, provide Copilot with some context to help it understand your request. For example, you could say, "I'm writing a blog post about the benefits of using Copilot. Can you help me come up with a title?"</li>
                <li><strong>Ask open-ended questions.</strong> Open-ended questions are more likely to elicit creative and interesting responses from Copilot. For example, instead of saying, "What are the benefits of using Copilot?", you could say, "What are some of the most surprising benefits of using Copilot?"</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment with different prompts.</strong> If you're not getting the results you want, try rephrasing your prompt or asking it in a different way.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="tips-and-tricks">
            <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use the "temperature" setting to control the creativity of Copilot's responses.</strong> A higher temperature will result in more creative responses, while a lower temperature will result in more factual responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the "top-p" setting to control the diversity of Copilot's responses.</strong> A higher top-p will result in more diverse responses, while a lower top-p will result in more focused responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the "stop sequences" setting to tell Copilot when to stop generating text.</strong> This can be useful for preventing Copilot from generating overly long or repetitive responses.</li>
