            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This tutorial will show you how to use Copilot to write code more efficiently. We will cover the basics of generating code, as well as more advanced techniques like using comments to guide Copilot's suggestions.</p>

            <h2>Generating Code</h2>
            <p>To generate code with Copilot, simply start typing and Copilot will automatically suggest completions. You can accept a suggestion by pressing the Tab key.</p>
            <p>For example, to create a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python, you could type the following:</p>
            <pre><code>
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
            </code></pre>
            <p>Copilot will likely suggest the entire function after you type the first line.</p>

            <h2>Using Comments to Guide Copilot</h2>
            <p>You can use comments to give Copilot more context and guide its suggestions. For example, if you want to create a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum, you could write the following comment:</p>
            <pre><code>
# A function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
            </code></pre>
            <p>Copilot will use this comment to generate the function for you.</p>
