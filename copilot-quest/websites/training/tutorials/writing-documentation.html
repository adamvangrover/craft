            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This tutorial will show you how to use Copilot to write documentation more efficiently. We will cover the basics of generating documentation, as well as more advanced techniques like using comments to guide Copilot's suggestions.</p>

            <h2>Generating Documentation</h2>
            <p>To generate documentation with Copilot, simply start typing and Copilot will automatically suggest completions. You can accept a suggestion by pressing the Tab key.</p>
            <p>For example, to create a simple README file, you could type the following:</p>
            <pre><code>
# My Project

This is a simple project to demonstrate how to use Copilot to write documentation.
            </code></pre>
            <p>Copilot will likely suggest the entire README file after you type the first line.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Using Comments to Guide Copilot</h2>
            <p>You can use comments to give Copilot more context and guide its suggestions. For example, if you want to create a function with a docstring, you could write the following comment:</p>
            <pre><code>
def add(a, b):
    """This function takes two numbers and returns their sum."""
    return a + b
            </code></pre>
            <p>Copilot will use this comment to generate the docstring for you.</p>
