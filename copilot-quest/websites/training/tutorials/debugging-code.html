            <h2>Identifying and Fixing Bugs</h2>
            <p>Copilot can help you identify and fix bugs in your code by suggesting corrections. For example, if you have a typo in your code, Copilot will likely suggest the correct spelling.</p>
            <p>Copilot can also help you fix more complex bugs. For example, if you have a logic error in your code, Copilot may be able to suggest a fix that resolves the issue.</p>

            <h2>Asking Copilot for Help</h2>
            <p>You can use comments to ask Copilot for help with debugging. For example, if you have a bug that you can't figure out, you could write a comment that describes the problem and asks for help.</p>
            <pre><code>
# This function is not working correctly. It should return the sum of two numbers, but it is returning the wrong value.
# Can you help me fix it?
def add(a, b):
    return a - b
            </code></pre>
            <p>Copilot will use this comment to suggest a fix for the bug.</p>
