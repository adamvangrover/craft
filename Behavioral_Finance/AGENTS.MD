# Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents working with the content in this directory and its subdirectories.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the overall repository structure, formatting, and writing style. Refer to the main `README.md` and other `AGENTS.MD` files for examples.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Ensure all documentation, explanations, and comments are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Follow standard Markdown syntax. Use formatting (headings, lists, bolding, etc.) to improve readability.
*   **Accuracy:** Verify the accuracy of all information, especially financial concepts, formulas, and examples.
*   **File Naming:** Use clear and consistent file names (e.g., `snake_case_for_files.md`, `PascalCaseForFolders/`).
*   **Links:**
    *   Use relative links for internal navigation.
    *   Verify that all links are functional.
*   **Updating Navigation:** When adding new content or significantly modifying existing content, ensure that relevant `README.md` files and `index.html` (if applicable) are updated to reflect these changes for discoverability.
*   **Code (if applicable):**
    *   Comment code adequately.
    *   Follow any language-specific style guides if established for this project.
    *   Ensure code is functional and tested.
*   **Review:** Before submitting changes, review your work for adherence to these guidelines and the specific task requirements.

## Directory-Specific Instructions: Behavioral Finance

### Inherits From
This document inherits general principles from the root `AGENTS.MD` file. Please review that first.

### 1. Purpose and Scope of this Directory
The `/Behavioral_Finance/` directory explores how psychological influences, cognitive biases, and emotional factors affect financial decision-making by individuals and institutions, and how these can impact financial markets.

The main entry point is `Behavioral_Finance/README.md`.

### 2. Content Structure and Types
Content is typically organized into:
*   `Key_Concepts.md`: Explaining core behavioral finance theories, biases (e.g., anchoring, herding, loss aversion, confirmation bias), and heuristics.
*   `Case_Studies.md`: Illustrating behavioral concepts through historical market events or hypothetical decision-making scenarios.
*   `Applications_in_Analysis.md` (Recommended): Discussing how understanding behavioral finance can improve investment analysis, credit assessment, and risk management.
*   Potentially, files on specific investor psychology types or market anomalies.

### 3. Specific Guidelines for Behavioral Finance Content
*   **Clear Definitions of Biases:** Each cognitive or emotional bias should be clearly defined with relatable examples.
*   **Distinction between Cognitive and Emotional Biases:** Where appropriate, categorize biases to help understand their origins and potential for mitigation.
*   **Real-World Relevance:** Connect concepts to actual market behavior or common investor mistakes. Case studies are very effective here.
*   **Implications for Analysts/Investors:** Focus on how awareness of these biases can lead to better decision-making and risk management.
*   **Avoid Overly Academic Tone:** While based on academic research, the explanations should be accessible to finance practitioners.

### 4. Linking
*   Link all key behavioral terms (anchoring, loss aversion, etc.) to the `Global_Financial_Glossary.md`.
*   Connect behavioral concepts to practical risk management in `/Risk_Management/`.
*   Link to decision-making processes discussed in `/Professional_Development/` (e.g., critical thinking).
*   Case studies could reference market events also discussed in `Market_Analysis_Quick_Start/` or CFA materials.

### 5. Roadmap / Planned Additions (Illustrative)
*   More case studies covering different market cycles or asset classes.
*   A section on debiasing techniques for analysts.
*   Exploration of neurofinance concepts (if appropriate and simplified).
*   Interactive quizzes or scenarios (potentially via Jupyter Notebooks) to test understanding of biases.

Refer to the root `AGENTS.MD` for general guidelines.
Refer to `Interactive_Notebooks/AGENTS.MD` if planning to create Jupyter Notebook based illustrations.
