# Behavioral Finance

## Overview

Welcome to the Behavioral Finance section. This area explores how psychological influences and cognitive biases affect financial decision-making by individuals, professional investors, and even financial markets as a whole.

Traditional finance theory often assumes that market participants are rational and make decisions to maximize their utility based on all available information. However, behavioral finance recognizes that human psychology plays a significant role, leading to decisions that can deviate from pure rationality. Understanding these behavioral aspects is crucial for financial advisors, portfolio managers, and individual investors alike.

## Purpose of this Section

The goals of this section are to:

*   Introduce the core concepts of behavioral finance and contrast them with traditional finance.
*   Identify and describe common cognitive and emotional biases that impact investment decisions.
*   Discuss how these biases can affect individual investor behavior and portfolio choices.
*   Explore the implications of behavioral finance for financial market phenomena (e.g., bubbles, anomalies).
*   Provide insights into how awareness of these biases can lead to better investment decision-making and more effective client advising.
