## Developer Notes & Areas for Impact

*   **Maintain `index.html`:** The `Learning_Paths/index.html` is the primary interactive viewer. When new `.md` learning path files are added to this directory, the navigation list (`<ul id="learning-path-nav-list">`) within `Learning_Paths/index.html` **must** be manually updated to include a link to the new path file.
*   **Review Existing Paths:** Regularly review existing paths to ensure they link to the most current and relevant content as the rest of the repository evolves. Outdated links or references in learning paths can be confusing.
*   **Granularity of Paths:** Consider if more granular or role-specific paths are needed (e.g., "Path for a First-Year Banking Analyst," "Path for Understanding Fixed Income Derivatives").
*   **Interactive Checklists:** Future enhancement could involve making the steps within a learning path interactive (e.g., checkboxes that users can tick off, with progress saved via local storage if feasible).

## Student & Teacher Notes (Implicitly covered in "How to Use This Section")

The "How to Use This Section" already provides guidance for both students (learners) and implicitly for teachers (how to structure assignments or guide students). Specific points:
*   **Students:** Focus on identifying a goal and following the path sequentially. Active engagement is key.
*   **Teachers:** Use paths as course outlines or recommend them to students based on their needs. Paths can highlight prerequisite knowledge.
