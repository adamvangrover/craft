            <h1>The Three Core Financial Statements</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There are three main financial statements that companies use to report their financial performance and position: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial health.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>1. Income Statement</h2>
            <p>The income statement, also known as the Profit & Loss (P&L) statement, shows a company's financial performance over a period of time (e.g., a quarter or a year). It is calculated as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>Revenues - Expenses = Net Income</code></pre>
            <p>It tells the story of a company's profitability during that period.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>2. Balance Sheet</h2>
            <p>The balance sheet presents a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It is based on the fundamental accounting equation:</p>
            <pre><code>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</code></pre>
            <p>This means a company's resources (assets) are funded by either debt (liabilities) or its owners' capital (equity).</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>3. Cash Flow Statement</h2>
            <p>The cash flow statement (CFS) shows how a company's cash has changed over a period of time. It reconciles the net income (from the income statement) to the actual change in cash (on the balance sheet). It is divided into three sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> Cash generated from a company's normal business operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> Cash used for or generated from investments in assets (like property, plant, and equipment).</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> Cash used for or generated from financing activities, such as issuing debt or equity, or paying dividends.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>How the Three Statements are Linked</h2>
            <p>The three financial statements are intrinsically linked:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net income</strong> from the income statement is the starting point for the cash flow from operating activities section on the cash flow statement.</li>
                <li><strong>Net income</strong> (less any dividends paid) also flows into the Retained Earnings account within Equity on the balance sheet.</li>
                <li>The <strong>ending cash balance</strong> on the cash flow statement becomes the cash balance on the balance sheet for that period.</li>
                <li><strong>Changes in balance sheet accounts</strong>, such as working capital (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory), directly impact the cash flow statement.</li>
            </ul>
