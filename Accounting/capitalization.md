# Capitalization

## Introduction

Capitalization is the process of recording a cost as an asset, rather than an expense. This is done when the cost is expected to provide a future economic benefit to the company over a period of time. Capitalized costs are then expensed over their useful life through depreciation (for tangible assets) or amortization (for intangible assets).

## Capitalization vs. Expensing

The decision to capitalize or expense a cost has a significant impact on a company's financial statements.

- **Capitalizing a cost:**
  - Increases assets on the balance sheet.
  - Delays the recognition of the expense on the income statement.
  - Results in higher net income in the short term.
- **Expensing a cost:**
  - Reduces net income immediately.
  - Has no impact on the balance sheet beyond the reduction in cash or increase in liabilities.

## Capitalization Policies

Companies establish capitalization policies to ensure consistency in their accounting treatment of costs. These policies typically specify a minimum dollar amount (a "capitalization threshold") for an item to be capitalized.

## Examples of Capitalized Costs

- **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** The cost of acquiring or constructing long-term assets.
- **Intangible Assets:** The cost of acquiring patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
- **Software Development Costs:** Certain costs incurred in the development of software for internal use can be capitalized.

## Example

A company purchases a machine for $100,000. The machine has a useful life of 10 years.

- **Initial Entry:**
  - Debit PP&E: $100,000
  - Credit Cash: $100,000
- **Annual Depreciation Entry (Straight-line):**
  - Debit Depreciation Expense: $10,000
  - Credit Accumulated Depreciation: $10,000

The cost of the machine is capitalized and then expensed over its 10-year useful life.
