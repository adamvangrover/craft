# Deferred Revenue Recognition

## Introduction

Deferred revenue, also known as unearned revenue, is a liability on a company's balance sheet that represents prepayment by customers for goods or services that have not yet been delivered. This module explains the concept of deferred revenue, the conditions for its recognition, and its impact on financial statements.

## Key Concepts

- **Accrual Basis Accounting:** Revenue is recognized when earned, not when cash is received.
- **Revenue Recognition Principle:** Revenue should be recognized in the period it is earned, regardless of when payment is received.

## Recognition Criteria

Under both GAAP and IFRS, revenue can only be recognized after the company has satisfied its performance obligation to the customer. The five-step model for revenue recognition is as follows:

1. **Identify the contract(s) with a customer.**
2. **Identify the performance obligations in the contract.**
3. **Determine the transaction price.**
4. **Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.**
5. **Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.**

## Example

A software company receives $1,200 on January 1st for a one-year subscription.

- **Initial Entry (January 1st):**
  - Debit Cash: $1,200
  - Credit Deferred Revenue: $1,200
- **Monthly Adjusting Entry (End of each month):**
  - Debit Deferred Revenue: $100
  - Credit Revenue: $100

This entry is made each month for 12 months. At the end of the year, the entire $1,200 will have been recognized as revenue, and the deferred revenue liability will be zero.

## Impact on Financial Statements

- **Balance Sheet:** Deferred revenue is a current liability.
- **Income Statement:** Recognized revenue is recorded on the income statement.
- **Cash Flow Statement:** The initial cash receipt increases cash from operations.
