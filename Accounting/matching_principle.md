# The Matching Principle

## Introduction

The matching principle is a cornerstone of accrual accounting. It requires that expenses be recognized in the same period as the revenues they helped to generate. This ensures that the income statement provides a more accurate picture of a company's profitability for a given period.

## Key Concepts

- **Cause and Effect:** Expenses are "matched" with the revenues they generate. For example, the cost of goods sold is an expense that is directly tied to sales revenue.
- **Systematic and Rational Allocation:** Some expenses, like depreciation, are not directly tied to a specific revenue stream. These are allocated over the useful life of the asset.
- **Immediate Recognition:** Some costs cannot be linked to any future revenue and are expensed as they are incurred. An example is administrative salaries.

## Example

A company purchases inventory for $1,000 in cash. In the following month, it sells the inventory for $1,500 on credit.

- **When the inventory is purchased:**
  - Debit Inventory: $1,000
  - Credit Cash: $1,000
- **When the inventory is sold:**
  - Debit Accounts Receivable: $1,500
  - Credit Sales Revenue: $1,500
  - Debit Cost of Goods Sold: $1,000
  - Credit Inventory: $1,000

The cost of the inventory ($1,000) is matched with the sales revenue ($1,500) in the same period.

## Importance

The matching principle prevents companies from manipulating their financial results by, for example, prepaying expenses in one period to reduce net income and then recognizing the benefit in a future period.
