# The Three Financial Statements

## Introduction

There are three main financial statements that companies use to report their financial performance and position: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement.

## 1. Income Statement

The income statement shows a company's financial performance over a period of time. It is calculated as follows:

**Revenues - Expenses = Net Income**

## 2. Balance Sheet

The balance sheet shows a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It is based on the following accounting equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

## 3. Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement shows how a company's cash has changed over a period of time. It is divided into three sections:

- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** Cash generated from a company's normal business operations.
- **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** Cash used for or generated from investments.
- **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** Cash used for or generated from financing activities, such as issuing debt or equity.

## How the Three Statements are Linked

The three financial statements are linked together in a number of ways:

- **Net income** from the income statement is the starting point for the cash flow statement.
- **Net income** also flows into retained earnings on the balance sheet.
- The **ending cash balance** on the cash flow statement is the cash balance on the balance sheet.
- **Changes in balance sheet accounts** (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory) are reflected in the cash flow statement.
