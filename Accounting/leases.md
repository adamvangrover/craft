# Operating and Finance Leases

## Introduction

A lease is a contractual arrangement calling for the lessee (user) to pay the lessor (owner) for use of an asset. The accounting for leases depends on whether the lease is classified as a finance lease or an operating lease.

## Lease Classification

Under both GAAP and IFRS, a lease is classified as a finance lease if it meets any one of the following criteria:

1. The lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.
2. The lessee has a purchase option that they are reasonably certain to exercise.
3. The lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the asset.
4. The present value of the lease payments amounts to substantially all of the fair value of the asset.
5. The asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.

If a lease does not meet any of these criteria, it is classified as an operating lease.

## Accounting for Leases

| Account | Finance Lease (Lessee) | Operating Lease (Lessee) |
|---|---|---|
| **Balance Sheet** | Right-of-use asset and lease liability | Right-of-use asset and lease liability |
| **Income Statement** | Amortization expense and interest expense | Single lease expense |

## Example

A company leases a machine for 5 years. The fair value of the machine is $100,000, and the present value of the lease payments is $95,000.

- **Finance Lease:** The lessee would record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability of $95,000. In each year, the lessee would record amortization expense on the asset and interest expense on the liability.
- **Operating Lease:** The lessee would record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability of $95,000. In each year, the lessee would record a single lease expense.

## Impact on Financial Ratios

The classification of a lease can have a significant impact on a company's financial ratios. For example, a finance lease will result in higher debt-to-equity and lower interest coverage ratios in the early years of the lease.
