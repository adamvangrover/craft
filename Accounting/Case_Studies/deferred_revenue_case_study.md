# Case Study: Deferred Revenue at Microsoft

## Company Background

Microsoft is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

## The Issue

Microsoft has a significant amount of deferred revenue on its balance sheet. This is primarily due to the fact that it sells multi-year subscriptions to its software products, such as Office 365.

## Accounting Treatment

When Microsoft receives cash from a customer for a multi-year subscription, it records the cash as an asset and the deferred revenue as a liability. The deferred revenue is then recognized as revenue over the life of the subscription.

## Example

Suppose a customer pays Microsoft $360 for a three-year subscription to Office 365.

- **Initial Entry:**
  - Debit Cash: $360
  - Credit Deferred Revenue: $360
- **Annual Adjusting Entry (for 3 years):**
  - Debit Deferred Revenue: $120
  - Credit Revenue: $120

## Analysis

By analyzing Microsoft's deferred revenue balance, investors can gain insights into the company's future revenue growth. A growing deferred revenue balance suggests that the company is signing up more customers for its subscription-based services, which is a positive indicator for future revenue.

## Discussion Questions

1. Why is deferred revenue a liability?
2. How does the recognition of deferred revenue affect Microsoft's income statement and cash flow statement?
3. What are the risks associated with a large deferred revenue balance?
