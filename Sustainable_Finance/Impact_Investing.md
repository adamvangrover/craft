# Impact Investing

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Impact investing differs from ESG integration. ESG is about managing risk (defensive). Impact is about targeting specific outcomes (offensive). For a credit analyst, impact investments often involve private markets, blended finance structures, or emerging market debt, requiring specialized due diligence.

## 1. What is Impact Investing?

The Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) defines impact investments as "investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return."

**The Three Pillars:**
1.  **Intentionality:** The investor must intend to have a positive social or environmental impact. It's not an accidental byproduct.
2.  **Financial Return:** It is an investment, not a grant. Returns can range from below-market (concessionary) to market-rate.
3.  **Measurement:** The impact must be measured and reported.

## 2. Impact vs. ESG vs. Philanthropy

| Feature | Philanthropy | Impact Investing | ESG Investing | Traditional Investing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Social Impact | Impact + Financial Return | Risk Adjusted Financial Return | Financial Return |
| **Returns** | -100% (Grant) | Concessionary to Market | Market | Market |
| **Impact Focus** | Primary | Dual Objective | Secondary (Risk Factor) | None |

## 3. Measuring Impact

Measurement is the hardest part. Common frameworks include:
*   **IRIS+:** A catalog of generally accepted performance metrics managed by the GIIN.
*   **UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals):** Mapping investments to the 17 global goals (e.g., No Poverty, Clean Energy).

**Common Metrics:**
*   Tons of CO2 equivalent avoided.
*   Number of low-income individuals served.
*   Liters of water saved.
*   Jobs created in underserved communities.

## 4. Blended Finance

Impact investing often uses **Blended Finance** structures, where public or philanthropic capital takes the "first loss" or provides a guarantee to de-risk the investment and attract private capital.
*   *Example:* A government development bank provides a 10% first-loss guarantee on a loan portfolio for small businesses in Africa. This improves the credit rating of the senior tranche, allowing institutional investors to buy it.

> **Pro Tip:**
> In blended finance deals, scrutinize the waterfall. Ensure the "concessionary" capital is truly absorbing the risk before your tranche gets hit. Understand the correlation of defaults in the underlying portfolio.

## Glossary Definitions

*   **Additionality:** The extent to which a new input adds to the existing outcome (i.e., would this impact have happened anyway without the investment?).
*   **Concessionary Returns:** Investment returns that are lower than the market rate for a comparable risk profile, accepted by investors to achieve a specific social or environmental impact.
*   **Blended Finance:** The strategic use of development finance and philanthropic funds to mobilize private capital flows to emerging and frontier markets.
