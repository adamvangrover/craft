# Sustainable Finance

> **Buy-Side Perspective:**
> Sustainable finance has moved from a niche consideration to a core component of risk management and capital allocation. For credit analysts, understanding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors is no longer optional—it is essential for assessing long-term creditworthiness, regulatory risk, and access to capital.
