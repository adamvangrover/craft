# A Guide to Regulatory Risk Ratings

## Introduction

This guide explains the U.S. regulatory risk rating system used by federal agencies like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to classify loans and other assets in a bank's portfolio.

Unlike an internal Probability of "Default" (PD) rating, which focuses on the likelihood of a future default, the regulatory rating system is focused on the present. It assesses the current quality of an asset based on identifiable weaknesses and the risk of principal "loss" to the lender.

## Part 1: The Two-Dimensional System - Pass vs. Criticized

The regulatory rating system is fundamentally a two-dimensional framework. Every loan is first categorized as either "Pass" or "Criticized."

### Pass Rating
A "Pass" rated loan is fundamentally sound. The analysis shows no existing or potential weaknesses that would jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. The borrower has a strong primary source of repayment, stable financial performance, and is expected to continue meeting its obligations in a timely manner.

### Criticized Ratings
A "Criticized" rating is assigned to any loan that is not rated "Pass". These are loans that exhibit potential or well-defined weaknesses. The "Criticized" designation is an umbrella term that is further broken down into several distinct categories of increasing severity, which are detailed below.

## Part 2: The "Criticized" Categories Explained

### Special Mention (SM)
This is the least severe criticized rating. A "Special Mention" rating is assigned to a loan that has **potential weaknesses** that, if left uncorrected, may result in a deterioration of the repayment prospects.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   The primary repayment source is still intact, but there are concerns about its long-term health.
*   Adverse trends are emerging, such as declining revenue, compressing margins, or tightening liquidity.
*   There is no well-defined weakness that currently jeopardizes the loan, but the loan requires close management attention.

### Substandard
A "Substandard" rating means the loan has a **well-defined weakness** that jeopardizes the orderly repayment of the debt. The risk of loss is now distinct.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   The primary source of repayment (e.g., operating cash flow) is no longer sufficient to service the debt.
*   The lender is now relying on secondary sources, such as the liquidation of collateral, asset sales, or refinancing.
*   There is a distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

### Doubtful
A "Doubtful" rating means all the weaknesses of a Substandard credit are present, but now the collection of the debt in full is **highly questionable and improbable**.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   The probability of loss is now high.
*   The classification as a "Loss" is deferred only because of a specific, pending event that could salvage the situation (e.g., a pending merger, a planned capital injection, or the orderly liquidation of collateral).

### Loss
A "Loss" rating is the final and most severe classification. A loan is classified as Loss when it is considered **uncollectible** and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   The prospect of any meaningful recovery is gone.
*   The loan is typically charged-off against the bank's loan loss reserves.

## Part 3: The Concept of Non-Accrual Status

"Non-Accrual" is a separate, but related, designation from the risk ratings above. It is an accounting treatment, not a rating itself, but it is a critical indicator of a problem loan.

**Definition:** A loan is placed on **non-accrual status** when the bank stops accruing interest income on it. This typically happens when the loan is **90 days or more past due** on its interest or principal payments, and the collection of future payments is not reasonably assured.

**Relationship to Ratings:**
*   A loan on non-accrual status will almost always be rated **Substandard** or worse.
*   The decision to place a loan on non-accrual is a clear signal that the risk of loss is significant, as the lender no longer expects to receive its full contractual return.
