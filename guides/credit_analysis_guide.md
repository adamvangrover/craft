## Part 1: The Foundations - Speaking the Language of Business

Every credit analysis starts with a deep understanding of financial accounting. This is the language of business, and fluency is non-negotiable. This foundational stage focuses on interpreting financial statements and understanding how to model them.

**Key Skills Covered:**
*   Mastering the three financial statements: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.
*   Understanding the principles of accrual accounting.
*   Performing financial statement analysis to identify trends and risks.
*   Learning the basics of 3-statement financial modeling.

**Where to Find It:**
*   **Primary Resource:** For a detailed walkthrough of financial statements and ratio analysis, please review the **[Financial Analysis and Reporting Guide](./financial_analysis_guide.md)**.
*   **CRAFT Module:** For in-depth lessons, quizzes, and case studies, explore the modules in `modules/Credit_Analysis/modules/01-foundations/`.

## Part 2: Understanding the Market - The External View

A company does not exist in a vacuum. Its ability to repay debt is heavily influenced by the health of the broader economy and the competitive intensity of its industry. A great company in a terrible industry is often a poor credit risk.

**Key Skills Covered:**
*   **Macroeconomic Analysis:** Understanding how factors like GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates impact all borrowers. An inverted yield curve, for example, is a powerful historical predictor of a recession.
*   **Industry Analysis:** Using frameworks like **Porter's Five Forces** to assess the attractiveness of an industry. The five forces are:
    1.  Threat of New Entrants
    2.  Bargaining Power of Buyers
    3.  Bargaining Power of Suppliers
    4.  Threat of Substitute Products
    5.  Rivalry Among Existing Competitors
    *   An industry with intense rivalry, powerful buyers, and low barriers to entry (like the airline industry) is inherently riskier for creditors.
*   **Peer Benchmarking:** Comparing a company's performance to its direct competitors on key industry metrics.

**Where to Find It:**
*   **CRAFT Module:** Explore the lessons on economic concepts, capital markets, and industry analysis in `modules/Credit_Analysis/modules/02-understanding-the-market/`.

## Part 3: The Analyst's Craft - Asking "Why?"

With the financial and market context established, the real craft of analysis begins. This involves looking beyond the numbers to understand the qualitative factors that drive a company's success and risk profile. This is where you move from being a calculator to being a true analyst.

**Key Skills Covered:**
*   **Business Model Analysis:** Understanding how the company makes money, its key products, and its customers.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** What gives the company a defensible edge? Is it a strong brand, low-cost production, proprietary technology, or something else? A **SWOT analysis** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a useful framework here.
*   **Management Assessment:** Evaluating the experience, track record, and credibility of the management team. Is their strategy believable and have they executed well in the past?
*   **Critical Thinking:** The ability to synthesize all the information (financial, market, qualitative) into a coherent credit narrative, identifying the key risks and mitigants.

**Where to Find It:**
*   **CRAFT Module:** The lessons on business risk and critical thinking can be found in `modules/Credit_Analysis/modules/03-the-analysts-craft/`.

## Part 4: The Credit Lifecycle in Action

Credit analysis is not a purely academic exercise; it's a practical process with a clear workflow. This workflow can be broken down into three key stages.

**Key Stages Covered:**
1.  **Due Diligence:** This is the systematic process of information gathering. It involves creating a checklist to collect all necessary financial, legal, and operational documents. A key part of due diligence for public companies is dissecting their SEC filings (like the 10-K), especially the "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion & Analysis" sections. The goal is to uncover any risks before a decision is made.

2.  **Writing the Credit Memorandum:** This is the primary output of the analysis. The credit memo is the document that tells the story of the borrower and makes a formal recommendation to approve or decline a loan. It must be clear, concise, and persuasive, starting with a powerful executive summary and logically defending the recommendation. A critical section is "Risks & Mitigants," which shows you have thought critically about what could go wrong and how to protect the lender.

3.  **Credit Monitoring:** The work doesn't stop when the deal is closed. Credit analysis is an ongoing process of monitoring the borrower's performance. This includes formal annual reviews, quarterly checks of financial covenant compliance, and being vigilant for "Early Warning Signs" (like declining cash flow or loss of a key customer) that could signal credit deterioration.

## Part 5: Advanced Topics - Structure, Covenants, and Legal Protections

Beyond the financial analysis, a creditor's risk is heavily defined by the legal structure of the loan. This involves understanding where you sit in the capital structure and what rules the borrower has to follow.

**Key Skills Covered:**
*   **The Capital Structure ("The Capital Stack"):** Understanding the hierarchy of repayment in a bankruptcy. **Senior Secured Debt** (like most bank loans) sits at the top and gets paid first from any collateral. **Unsecured Bonds** sit lower, and **Equity** is at the very bottom, absorbing the first losses.
*   **The Credit Agreement:** This is the legally binding contract governing the loan. A critical skill is understanding the **covenants**, which are the rules the borrower must follow.
    *   **Affirmative Covenants:** Things the borrower *must* do (e.g., provide financial statements).
    *   **Negative Covenants:** Things the borrower *cannot* do without permission (e.g., sell major assets, take on more debt).
    *   **Financial Covenants:** Specific performance metrics the borrower must maintain (e.g., Debt/EBITDA must stay below 4.0x). A breach of a covenant is an early warning sign that gives the lender a seat at the table to address problems.

**Where to Find It:**
*   **CRAFT Module:** The modules on covenants, documentation, and debt structuring can be found in `modules/Credit_Analysis/modules/06-advanced-topics/`.

## Part 6: Communication and Narrative - Telling the Story

The final and most crucial skill is to synthesize all of your analysis into a clear, persuasive story. A 100-page analysis is useless if you cannot communicate its key takeaways effectively to decision-makers.

**Key Skills Covered:**
*   **Moving from "What" to "Why" and "So What?":** It's not enough to state a fact (the "what"). You must explain the reason for it (the "why") and its implication for credit risk (the "so what").
    *   *What:* "Revenue declined by 10%."
    *   *Why:* "...because the company lost its largest customer."
    *   *So What:* "...which highlights a key risk in customer concentration and puts future cash flows at risk."
*   **Forming a Credit Thesis:** Building a coherent narrative that acknowledges the strengths, identifies the key risks, and explains why, on balance, the loan should be approved or declined.
*   **Clear and Concise Communication:** Structuring your thoughts logically in a credit memorandum and presenting them effectively in committee.

**Where to Find It:**
*   **CRAFT Module:** The modules on critical thinking, narrative, and communication skills can be found in `modules/Credit_Analysis/modules/07-communication-skills/`.
